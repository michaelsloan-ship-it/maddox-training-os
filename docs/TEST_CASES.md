# Test Cases

## Purpose

This document owns test groups before they expand into concrete tests. It intentionally avoids hundreds of date-specific rows.

Canonical hierarchy:

Program > Week > Day > Records > Screen projections.

No test group authorizes changing approved v8.4 data, mutating production data, installing tools, or inventing training content.

Detailed day-scenario-derived test material lives in `docs/DAY_SCENARIO_TEST_CASES.md`. That file preserves scenario fixture expectations; this file remains the compact test-group registry.

## Expansion Rule

Expand a group into concrete tests only when:

- it traces to contract/requirement/defect/scope IDs
- the test layer is selected
- fixture/source needs are known
- mutation risk is controlled
- Mike/product acceptance criteria are clear

If information is missing, use:

- Status: Needs source inspection
- Reason
- Next step

## Initial Test Groups

| Test group | Source contracts | Related defects | Intended test layer | Surfaces covered | Fixture needs | Automation readiness | Not-yet-expanded note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TCG-001 Site-wide route smoke coverage | ABC-001, ABC-002, ABC-011 | DEF-016, DEF-027 | Playwright, static | Today, Day, Session, Calendar, History, Dashboard, KPIs, Plan, Exports, Parent view | Route inventory; safe read-only route list. | Needs route/component inspection | Start with one row per surface, not one row per date. |
| TCG-002 Canonical activity presentation across surfaces | ABC-003, ABC-008 | DEF-021, DEF-024, DEF-027, DEF-028 | Vitest, Playwright | Day, Session, completed-session/read-only, Today summaries | ActivityPresentation fixtures; completed-session route/state fixture. | Day + active Session parity covers all 96 v8.4 active session dates; completed-session route still needs fixture/state for Playwright. | Keep broader expansion contract-based; do not add one row per date. |
| TCG-003 Forbidden raw/source labels across athlete-facing UI | ABC-004 | DEF-025, DEF-027 | Vitest, Playwright | Day, Session, Today, Calendar, completed-session, summaries | Known forbidden string list; route inventory. | Partially ready | Keep assertions contract-based; do not add one test per date. |
| TCG-004 Today/Day/Session consistency | ABC-002, ABC-003, ABC-012 | DEF-021, DEF-022, DEF-024 | Vitest, Playwright | Today, Day, Session | Current-date fixture and representative v8.4 dates. | Day readiness covers all 96 v8.4 plan dates; Today route claims still need separate coverage. | Today must equal canonical Day before broader route claims. |
| TCG-005 Calendar/History/Dashboard day-status consistency | ABC-001, ABC-002, ABC-006, ABC-007 | DEF-014, DEF-016, DEF-027 | Vitest, Playwright | Calendar, History, Dashboard, Day | Day status fixtures with explicit caveats. | Calendar compact ordering/status/navigation coverage implemented locally; completed-session, Training Work, attended/partial Sport Load, KPI, and mixed evidence flow through shared Day/Calendar projections. History/Dashboard still need fixtures. | Validate status meanings, not every date combination. |
| TCG-006 KPI visibility and deferred status | ABC-002, ABC-007 | DEF-016, DEF-REACT-DUPLICATE-KEY-EASY-SPIN-001, KPI roadmap items | Vitest, Playwright, manual UAT | Day, KPIs, Session, Dashboard, History, Calendar | KPI baseline/retest fixtures; explicit deferral support inspection. | Repeated-instruction rendering regression ready; broader status coverage needs fixture. | Missing KPI data must not become deferred data; repeated valid instructions must retain stable contextual render identity. |
| TCG-007 Sport Load as planned work | ABC-005 | DEF-014, data propagation risks | Vitest, Playwright | Today, Day, Calendar, History, Dashboard, Parent view | Sport Load day fixtures and record/caveat fixtures. | Calendar expandable Sport Load details and direct unified-log navigation implemented locally; broader surfaces still need fixtures. | Sport Load and Training Work evidence remain separate. |
| TCG-008 Completed-session/read-only regression coverage | ABC-003, ABC-004, ABC-008, ABC-010 | DEF-028 | Playwright, Vitest | Completed-session/read-only at `app/session/[id]/page.tsx?mode=view`, Previous Attempt gate, Session, Day | Saved-session/read-only route state fixture; safe navigation guards; existing `e2e/activity-presentation-proof.spec.ts` is proof-of-life only and did not exercise this branch. | Needs completed-session/read-only fixture/state | Do not mutate saved session records to create the state. Route ownership is recorded; concrete test generation remains deferred. |
| TCG-009 Read-only QA dangerous-action guardrails | ABC-010 | QA-AUTOMATION-002, DEF-028 | Static, Playwright | Playwright specs and QA scripts | Dangerous action list; route inventory. | Ready for existing proof spec; broader suite needs inventory. | Guardrails must fail before unsafe clicks. |
| TCG-010 Sync/status visibility coverage | ABC-001, ABC-002, ABC-006, ABC-007 | sync/status risks in data propagation docs | Vitest, Playwright, manual UAT | Today, Day, History, Dashboard, KPIs, Exports | Local-only, sync pending, sync failed, record-not-supported fixtures. | Needs fixture | Do not imply cloud sync or completion without explicit evidence. |
| TCG-011 Plan/Gantt daily Sport Load timing | ABC-005 | DEF-GANTT-SPORTLOAD-DURATION-001 | Vitest, manual UAT | Plan/Gantt | v8.4 phase labels and Sport Loads. | Ready for helper coverage; Mike still reviews visual acceptance. | Keep concrete assertions focused on reusable timeline, marker/bar, date-span semantics, and visual section grouping, not one-off browser tests. |
| TCG-012 Parent-approved forward-plan integrity | ABC-001, ABC-002, ABC-003, ABC-005, ABC-011, ABC-012 | PLAN-CONTENT-001, PLAN-TRYOUT-EXTENSION-2026-001, DEF-031, DEF-DAY-DURATION-CONTRACT-001 | Vitest, route render, manual UAT | Canonical Day and date-level logging for 2026-08-14 through 2026-09-18 | Approved forward source rows, fixed Sport Loads, KPI battery, recovery-day roles, and conditional advancement state. | Automated projection/matrix covers the 36-date period; parent source-diff and visual acceptance pending. | One reusable matrix owns duration, identity, duplication, workload and event-state assertions; representative route fixtures avoid a one-test-per-date browser matrix. |
| TCG-013 Forward product-quality browser contract | ABC-002, ABC-003, ABC-004, ABC-005, ABC-007, ABC-010, ABC-011 | DEF-KPI-CANONICAL-TEST-001, DEF-FORWARD-PLACEHOLDER-CONTENT-001, DEF-FORWARD-CONTENT-COMPLETENESS-001 | Vitest, Playwright, manual UAT | All Aug 14-Sep 6 Day/Log routes and KPI Dashboard | Canonical forward projection; installed Chrome; ephemeral port 3100 production server. | Implemented locally; parent visual acceptance pending. | One loop covers all forward routes read-only; representative screenshots provide evidence without a 48-row documentation matrix. |
| TCG-014 Compact mobile Calendar rows | ABC-001, ABC-002, ABC-010 | CAL-UX-MOBILE-DAY-ROWS-001, DEF-027 | Route render, Playwright, manual UAT | Calendar at mobile and desktop widths | Current-week canonical Calendar rows; installed Chrome; ephemeral production server. | Implemented on work branch; Mike Preview acceptance pending. | Contract-based assertions cover seven-row week grouping, bounded mobile density, Today height parity, one direct log action, expansion, desktop preservation, and zero horizontal overflow without a per-date browser matrix. |
| TCG-015 Read-only Project Owner Agent boundary | GOV-PO-AGENT-001, ABC-010 | None | Vitest, Playwright | Typed portfolio tools including deterministic next-work candidates, lifecycle/contradiction reconciliation, PO Agent API, safe rendered responses, usage metadata, unlinked Project Owner Lab, ordinary athlete navigation | Canonical `docs/SCOPE.md`; live-failure candidate fixture; structured golden scenarios; stubbed browser agent response; no live model call in CI. | Phase B implemented, deterministic correction validated, and Product Owner live acceptance passed. | Prove stale P0/review-only exclusion, current-sprint ordering, contradiction propagation, safe Markdown, usage limitations, no write-capable tools, explicit unconfigured state, unlinked/read-only Lab presentation, and unchanged athlete route behavior without testing Phase C persistence. |
| TCG-016 Provider-neutral gateway foundation | MODEL-ROUTING-001, GOV-PO-AGENT-001, ABC-010 | None | Vitest, existing Phase B Playwright compatibility | `lib/intelligence/` typed contracts, deterministic dry-run router, context budget, pricing/usage normalization, privacy-safe telemetry, Phase B boundary | Fixture-only provider/model registries and approvals; no live provider implementation or model call. | MR-A merged to main. | Prove deterministic/no-model routing, local eligibility/fallback, task-specific approval, privacy/capability/health/context/cost/tier rejection, explicit no-route behavior, visible evidence omission, secret-free telemetry, and unchanged Phase B runtime without starting Phase C. |
| TCG-017 PO Agent context-packing integration | MODEL-ROUTING-001, GOV-PO-AGENT-001, ABC-010 | None | Vitest, existing PO Lab Playwright compatibility | Deterministic PO task policy, evidence packet builder, legacy/shadow/packed modes, context telemetry, bounded next-work projection, API/Lab compatibility | Canonical `docs/SCOPE.md`; accepted next-work fixture; mocked agent runner; no live model call in CI. | MR-B architecture, hardening, and one packed Sol acceptance passed; ready for commit/PR. | Prove mandatory evidence retention, visible optional omission, explicit packed fallback, no duplicate candidate payload, no extra shadow inference, unchanged Sol/read-only/fail-closed behavior, and preserved next-work recommendation/contradictions/alternatives/provenance. Secondary review-only items must retain deterministic classification, must not be promoted, and must remain grounded if mentioned; omission from general model prose is acceptable unless explicitly required response coverage. |
