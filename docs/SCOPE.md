# Scope

## Purpose

This is the canonical scope, priority, status, sequencing, roadmap, defects-summary, KPI-roadmap, training/source-epic, source-review, and next-task document for Maddox Training OS.

Other planning docs may retain historical detail temporarily, but active scope decisions should be represented here.

## Current Checkpoint

- Branch: `main`.
- Current clean checkpoint: `38a2751` (`Merge PR #4: run forward Playwright QA in GitHub Actions`), deployed and Production-smoked on 2026-08-21.
- Completed chain: `e838ced` captured summer 4v4 scope, `0bba866` imported the 4v4 Sport Loads, `d922217` fixed Day stacked Sport Load rendering, and `f247959` fixed Plan/Gantt Sport Load sourcing from v8.4.
- Environment isolation is runtime-verified: Production remains on Supabase ref `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko`; a fresh 2026-08-21 Vercel Preview build on `verify/preview-staging-runtime-2026-08-21` emitted `[ENV_PROOF] vercel_env=preview supabase_ref=npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz` and would fail if Preview were not mapped to staging. No Supabase writes or secrets were used.
- `DEF-GANTT-SPORTLOAD-DURATION-001` is fixed at `8c51cc8`, visually accepted by Mike, pushed to `main`, and production-smoked. Production served `8c51cc8`; `/plan` returned 200; accepted daily Gantt indicators were present; the production Supabase ref was present and the staging ref was absent.
- `DEF-REACT-DUPLICATE-KEY-EASY-SPIN-001` is fixed, pushed at `7a70272`, and production-smoked. Isolated Chrome loaded `/kpis` with no duplicate-key matches, console warnings/errors, or page errors; both valid `Easy spin 2 minutes.` entries remained rendered.
- QA ownership is now active in GitHub Actions: Vitest, TypeScript, a clean production build, and the forward Playwright suite run deterministically in CI. `QA-AUTOMATION-OWNERSHIP-001`, `QA-PLAYWRIGHT-SMOKE-001`, and `DEF-QA-CODEX-RUNNER-001` remain In progress only for the remaining broader core-route/release-gate coverage.
- Earlier docs capture after commit `1c336a0` (`feat(kpis): show protocols and compute shuttle distance`); Vercel Preview for `preprod/kpi-protocols-2026-06-30` showed badge `1c336a0 · preview`.
- Preview `/kpis` displayed existing KPI results/baselines similar to production. Mike's later Vercel dashboard check confirmed Preview previously pointed to production Supabase through All-Environments variables; the Vercel config has since been split by environment.
- Previous docs checkpoint: docs capture after pushed commit `f5c35a8` (`fix(projections): clarify controlled cardio copy`); repo was clean before that docs-only capture.
- The all-day load-classification audit is completed and Production-verified: controlled cardio is deterministic at 45 minutes on easy days, 30 on medium days, and 20 on hard days; `DEF-029`, `DEF-030`, and `DEF-032` are closed, and the canonical Day presentation work behind `DEF-031` is in Production.
- Bell Sensplex 4v4 summer hockey schedule for July-August 2026 is captured as `SPORT-LOAD-4V4-SUMMER-2026`, a P1 planned Sport Load integration scope item. It is a high-value hockey stimulus, not an automatic overload emergency.
- Summer 4v4 implementation chain is pushed through `f247959`: source import, Day/Today, Calendar, and Plan/Gantt now derive planned Sport Loads from v8.4 where expected.
- Closed-Loop Training Intelligence is registered as a future design-governed architecture program. It is not current app behavior and must not be retrofitted into the current application until `DESIGN-GATE-001` passes.
- Previous projection-readiness checkpoint: repo clean and synced after pushed commit `6ab3f5e` (`test(projections): cover all v8.4 day readiness`).
- Tonight's stabilization commits are pushed: `9fd4c73` (`fix(session): align completed summary title with canonical presentation`), `c20432c` (`fix(projections): align planned activity classification across day and session`), and `05019f5` (`test(projections): cover day-session parity across v8.4 sessions`).
- Earlier settled production baseline: local `main` == `origin/main` == Vercel production at the time of Phase 1 completion.
- Current verified pushed/deployed Production baseline: `38a2751`; Vercel state READY and public `/calendar` returned 200 with badge `v0.1.0 · 38a2751 · production`.
- Production badge confirmed: `v0.1.0 · 38a2751 · production`.
- Historical pre-hardening production baseline: `7b48a3e` (`Render calendar from v8.4 day coverage`).
- Git state is the repo source of truth; browser/build badges are runtime context only.
- Phase 1 docs/scope-control checkpoint is complete.
- Calendar coverage from v8.4 was fixed and accepted.
- v8.4 covers all 96 dates from `2026-06-15` through `2026-09-18`.
- v8.4 app import package remains authoritative for app training data.
- Stash exists and must not be applied unless explicitly requested: `stash@{0} WIP KPI cloud sync before master reconciliation`.
- ACTIVITY-PRESCRIPTION-001A/B/C produced local uncommitted app-code WIP, but it is blocked and not commit-ready.
- `SURFACE-PRESENTATION-CONSUMER-AUDIT-001` is completed as an inspect-only audit; no files were changed during the audit.
- `QA-AUTOMATION-002` Playwright proof-of-life is completed: installed Google Chrome channel launched successfully on macOS Catalina `10.15.8` without bundled browser install.
- `DEF-028` is fixed, automated-tested, committed, and pushed at `9fd4c73`; completed-session/read-only now prefers canonical day/session presentation title without mutating saved records.
- Day + active Session planned-activity parity is verified across all 96 v8.4 active session dates; the original 84-date baseline was established by `05019f5` and extended under `PLAN-TRYOUT-EXTENSION-2026-001`.
- All 96 v8.4 plan dates from `2026-06-15` through `2026-09-18` are verified athlete-usable at the Day projection layer; the original 84-date baseline was established by `6ab3f5e` and extended under `PLAN-TRYOUT-EXTENSION-2026-001`.
- QA Contract Framework Loop 1B completed as inspect-only route/component discovery.
- QA Contract Framework Loop 1C records discovered route/component ownership in QA docs only; no app behavior or test generation.
- Next stabilization lane should be selected from the remaining P1 queue; data-write/sync tasks still require separate approval.

## Scope System Rules

- `docs/SCOPE.md` owns active scope, priority, status, sequencing, roadmap, defects summary, KPI roadmap, training/source epics, source-review items, and next-task planning.
- `AGENTS.md` owns durable Codex rules.
- `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` owns the current checkpoint/handoff only.
- `docs/AGENT_REPORT.md` owns the latest agent report only.
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INVENTORY.md` owns temporary documentation inventory and consolidation recommendations.
- Do not create new planning markdown files without explicit user approval.
- If new scope is discovered, add or update a record here using the Minimum Record Template.
- Before answering "what is next", inspect this file.

## Scope Hardening

Old scope-like markdown files are dead-end stubs. Do not read them for active scope, priority, sequencing, roadmap, defects, KPI roadmap, training/source epics, source-review items, or next-task ownership.

Historical detail for those files is recoverable through git history. This avoids contaminating future AI context with stale planning bodies.

## Minimum Record Template

Every active scope item should use this structure, either as a detailed record below or as a compact row in an index that links to a detailed record.

`Scope review required` means the item must be inspected/reconciled before implementation. It does not mean ready to code.

## Priority Model

- P0: data integrity, production safety, scope-control blockers.
- P1: core workflow or product-trust failure.
- P2: confusing UX, incomplete explanation, or medium defect.
- P3: future enhancement.

## Lane Model

## Product Decisions

| ID | Decision | Status | Links / evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEC-DAY-001 | Today must route to canonical Day page; one day, one truth. | In progress | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` |
| DEC-SOURCE-001 | v8.4 app import package is authoritative for app training data. | Completed | `imports/v8.4/README.md` |
| DEC-CALENDAR-001 | Calendar date coverage must come from v8.4, not legacy `data/plan.json`. | Completed | Commit `7b48a3e` |
| DEC-CALENDAR-002 | Calendar is a compact current-week-first index with collapsed rows, inline detail expansion, and one direct `/log/<date>` action; `/day/<date>` remains compatible. Calendar loads Training Work, completed-session, Sport Load, and KPI evidence into `buildDayEvidenceProjection()` and derives status/action only from `buildCalendarDayProjection()` without merging persistence streams. | Completed | Parent Calendar V2 decision; Production + Playwright-verified mobile/desktop Calendar |
| DEC-EVIDENCE-001 | Missing data is not deferred data; deferral must be explicit. | In progress | prior KPI roadmap content merged here; use git history only |
| DEC-RECOVERY-001 | Recovery days are not blank days; appropriate recovery days include intentional low-intensity development work. | In progress | prior training epics content merged here; use git history only |
| DEC-SPORTLOAD-001 | Sport Load logging and Training Work logging remain independent. | Completed | `AGENTS.md` |
| DEC-LANGUAGE-001 | User-facing UI should say `Sport Load`, not `External Load`, except legacy/internal names. | In progress | `AGENTS.md` |
| DEC-KPI-001 | Compare Maddox against himself over time, not adult/NHL standards. | Completed | KPI roadmap intake |
| DEC-KPI-002 | Do not use flat 400m as the primary hockey-shift test; prefer a 45-second repeated shuttle / shift simulation. | Completed | KPI roadmap intake |
| DEC-KPI-003 | There is one 14-item KPI Test; Aug 20, 2026 is the canonical scheduled test date for every active KPI in the 2026 plan. | Completed | Parent product decision; `lib/kpiSchedule.ts`; deterministic 14-item route/CI coverage |
| DEC-QA-LOCAL-001 | Codex browser QA uses an ephemeral same-context production server on port 3100 because the command sandbox cannot reach the parent-owned host server on port 3000. | Completed locally | `playwright.forward.config.ts`; localhost diagnostics 2026-08-13 |
| DEC-AI-001 | AI Coach recommends; parent approves. | Not started | Prior AI Coach strategy content merged here; use git history only |
| DEC-SOURCE-REVIEW-001 | Gemini/OvertimeAthlete recommendations are source-review inputs only, not source of truth. | Completed | Gemini intake |
| DEC-DESIGN-GATE-001 | Closed-Loop Training Intelligence implementation is forbidden until conceptual, functional, technical, research/validation, transition, data-retention, integration, QA/safety, and build-readiness gates are accepted. | In progress | `DESIGN-GATE-001`, `docs/design/DESIGN_GATE.md` |
| DEC-CURRENT-APP-001 | Current Maddox Training OS remains the production system; v8.4 remains authoritative while future methodology architecture is designed in parallel. | In progress | `TRANSITION-001`, `docs/design/DESIGN_GATE.md` |
| DEC-METHODOLOGY-001 | No silent plan rewrites; future recommendation-driven adjustments require parent approval and audit trail. | In progress | `MODEL-GOVERNANCE-001`, `docs/design/DECISION_LOG.md` |
| DEC-FORWARD-PLAN-001 | Parent-approved forward plan cutover begins 2026-08-14; dates through 2026-08-13 remain protected history. | In progress | `PLAN-CONTENT-001`, parent approval on 2026-08-13 |
| DEC-FORWARD-PLAN-002 | The parent-approved 2026 performance period continues through 2026-09-18, with Pathway and U12B tryout Sport Loads replacing the obsolete Sep 1 tryout assumption. | In progress | `PLAN-TRYOUT-EXTENSION-2026-001`, parent approval on 2026-08-19 |
| DEC-SCORING-001 | LLMs may extract structured exercise attributes, but final exercise-domain scores must come from deterministic, testable scoring rules plus review/approval gates. | In progress | `KNOWLEDGE-INGESTION-001`, `HEURISTIC-SCORING-001` |
| DEC-LOAD-VECTOR-001 | Expert/rule-derived baseline domain vectors and athlete-specific personalized effective load vectors are separate concepts; athlete output must not mutate the global baseline matrix. | In progress | `ATHLETE-PERSONALIZATION-001` |
| DEC-RESEARCH-001 | Open-source/research repositories may inform validation and thresholds, but no repository, dataset, commercial API, graph DB, vector DB, ML service, or final domain count is selected by this docs capture. | In progress | `RESEARCH-REPOSITORIES-001`, `DOMAIN-DECISION-001`, `docs/design/DECISION_LOG.md` |

## Current Sprint / Next Codex Task

Current sprint: Production is `38a2751`; the approved forward/tryout plan, mobile Calendar, environment-fit drill presentation, controlled-cardio fixes, and GitHub-owned forward Playwright regression gate are live and verified. Fresh Preview isolation to staging is also runtime-proven.

Next task brief:

- Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, and this file first.
- Environment isolation is complete for current Production and fresh Preview deployments; keep normal no-secret/no-production-write guardrails.
- `ENV-SAFETY-LOCAL-PROD-GUARD` remains a stale `Scope review required` detailed record while current sprint evidence says environment isolation is complete; reconcile it before treating it as executable work.
- `QA-PLAYWRIGHT-SMOKE-001` is complete on PR #6 final head: Today redirect and Plan/Gantt read-only browser coverage are CI-owned and green.
- Merge and Production-smoke `DEF-PLAN-GANTT-14WEEK-SPAN-001`; then prioritize `DEF-DAY-DURATION-CONTRACT-001` as the next athlete-facing P1: define authoritative duration scopes without forcing unlike totals to match or inventing a replacement total.
- Keep `DEF-QA-USAGE-LEDGER-001` as P2 workflow cleanup after the remaining P1 QA/duration work.
- Do not implement Closed-Loop methodology architecture during any of these current-app tasks.
- Do not edit `imports/v8.4/data/*.json` unless a later task explicitly asks.
- Do not mutate Supabase or saved records.

Execution gate: tactical current-app defects may be fixed separately as bounded work after discovery, but Closed-Loop methodology implementation remains gated by `DESIGN-GATE-001`.

## Detailed Scope Records

### APP-ICONS-2026-001 — Approved Home Screen identity

- ID: APP-ICONS-2026-001
- Title: Install Mike's approved Maddox Training OS icon.
- Type: Task
- Parent: M.C.S. Apps maintenance
- Priority: P1
- Status: In progress
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Mike's October 20 implementation handoff and approved PNG package.
- Problem: Generic Home Screen identity is difficult to distinguish from other apps.
- Desired outcome: Exact approved lime M artwork and correct application name on iPhone/iPad.
- In scope: Approved PNG assets, layout icon metadata, manifest icon references and Apple title; commit, deploy and read-only verification.
- Out of scope: Training content, application flows, Supabase configuration or records, schema, logging, and unrelated QA changes.
- Acceptance criteria: Standard checks pass; intended deployment is Ready; served metadata and icon bytes match approved assets. Real-device installation is Mike's final visual check.
- Dependencies: Existing production Vercel project and Git integration.
- Risks: Safari may retain previously installed shortcut icons.
- Next action: Run required checks, publish approved identity, verify served assets.
- Links / evidence: app/layout.tsx, app/manifest.ts, public/icons/maddox-training-os-*.png.


### CAL-UX-MOBILE-DAY-ROWS-001

- ID: CAL-UX-MOBILE-DAY-ROWS-001
- Title: Compact mobile Calendar day rows
- Type: Defect / UX
- Parent: Calendar V2 / `DEC-CALENDAR-002`
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Mike mobile Calendar review on 2026-08-18.
- Problem: Mobile Calendar renders individual dates as large stacked cards, defeating the compact Calendar V2 scanning model.
- Desired outcome: On mobile, Calendar preserves one compact horizontal row per day inside a seven-row week group.
- In scope: responsive Calendar row presentation; compact day/date, title, load, status, action, Today marker, and Details control; mobile density and overflow regression coverage.
- Out of scope: data architecture changes; evidence projection changes; persistence changes; Supabase changes; training-plan changes; deleting `/day` routes; unnecessary desktop redesign.
- Acceptance criteria:
  1. One day renders per compact horizontal row; no giant mobile day cards.
  2. Each week remains a grouped block of seven rows.
  3. Date/day and plan title remain immediately identifiable.
  4. Load, status, direct `/log/<date>` action, and Details remain compactly visible.
  5. Today is highlighted without materially increasing row height or duplicating its label.
  6. Only the selected row expands; collapsed rows do not duplicate expanded details.
  7. Touch controls remain semantic, accessible, and usable.
  8. Mobile has no horizontal page overflow and supports rapid multi-date scanning.
  9. Desktop/tablet Calendar behavior remains intact.
  10. Canonical evidence/status logic remains untouched.
- Dependencies: accepted Calendar V2 implementation; `DEC-CALENDAR-002`; TCG-005 and TCG-007.
- Risks: over-compression could reduce legibility or touch usability; responsive changes could unintentionally alter desktop grid placement.
- Next action: Maintain as regression coverage; no further mobile Calendar work is required unless new product QA finds a defect.
- Links / evidence: Parent-approved overnight work order; Production acceptance; `app/calendar/page.tsx`; `e2e/calendar-compact.spec.ts`; GitHub Actions Playwright gate; 390x844 browser measurement showed seven compact current-week rows with zero horizontal overflow and Today height parity.

### SCOPE-CONSOLIDATION-001

- ID: SCOPE-CONSOLIDATION-001
- Title: Scope system consolidation
- Type: Task
- Parent: Scope control
- Priority: P0
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Docs-only
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Current task
- Problem: Scope and priority were split across several docs with overlapping ownership.
- Desired outcome: `docs/SCOPE.md` becomes the single canonical active scope system.
- In scope: create this file, merge active scope, update pointers, update AGENTS/session/report/inventory.
- Out of scope: app code, v8.4 source JSON, Supabase, tooling, stash, commit, push.
- Acceptance criteria: active queue and current sprint exist here; duplicate scope docs are non-canonical; AGENTS points here.
- Dependencies: Completed Phase 1 review/push checkpoint after the `f02bff4` pushed/deployed baseline.
- Risks: historical detail may still need archive review.
- Next action: Use this file as the active scope source for the next approved implementation task.
- Links / evidence: `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INVENTORY.md`, prior reconciled docs.

### ENV-SAFETY-RECON-001

- ID: ENV-SAFETY-RECON-001
- Title: Environment/data safety reconciliation
- Type: Initiative
- Parent: Data integrity / production safety
- Priority: P0
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Docs-only
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: prior environment, data sync, environment safety, and testing docs were merged here; use git history only.
- Problem: Environment, deployment, KPI sync, and production backfill docs contain historical/stale claims.
- Desired outcome: current environment and write-target truth is clear before any cloud write or deploy.
- In scope: reconcile staging/production/local state, KPI stash status, required confirmation commands, production-risk guardrails.
- Out of scope: cloud writes, deploys, schema changes, stash application.
- Acceptance criteria: package scripts are classified; Supabase/Vercel/env references are identified by file path and purpose; key names are listed without values; forbidden write/deploy/backfill actions are blocked pending explicit approval.
- Dependencies: docs-only review; no production action.
- Risks: stale docs could lead to accidental production writes if not reconciled.
- Next action: Maintain the established target-confirmation and no-secret/no-production-write guardrails for future environment-sensitive work.
- Links / evidence: `scripts/confirm-write-target.mjs`, `scripts/env-whoami.mjs`, `scripts/preflight.mjs`, `stash`.

Ground Truth Baseline:

- Do not read, print, copy, or expose secret values.
- List env key names only, never values.
- Observed env key names:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`
  - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VERCEL_ENV`
- Files/scripts observed to reference Supabase/Vercel/env keys or environment behavior:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `MIGRATION_NOTES.md`
  - `app/plan/page.tsx`
  - `app/session/[id]/error.tsx`
  - `app/session/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `components/BuildBadge.tsx`
  - `components/ClientErrorProbe.tsx`

  - `lib/storage/completedSessionRepository.ts`
  - `lib/storage/externalLoadRepository.ts`
  - `lib/storage/localSessionRepository.ts`
  - `lib/storage/trainingWorkRepository.ts`
  - `lib/supabase/client.ts`
  - `scripts/confirm-write-target.mjs`
  - `scripts/env-whoami.mjs`
  - `scripts/run-with-build-info.mjs`
- `package.json` script names observed:
  - `dev`
  - `build`
  - `start`
  - `start:lan`
  - `ios:test`
  - `vercel:build`
  - `test`
  - `lint`
- Allowed read-only/safe verification commands for the inspect-only reconciliation:
  - `git status --short`
  - `git diff --check`
  - `find . -maxdepth 3 -name "*.md" | sort`
  - `rg -l` / `rg -o` searches that print file names or env key names only
  - `node -e` commands that print package script names only
  - reading source files without printing secret values
- Forbidden until explicitly approved:
  - destructive scripts
  - migrations
  - Supabase writes
  - production deploys
  - backfill scripts
  - any command requiring production credentials
  - any command that prints `.env.local` values or Supabase keys/tokens/URLs
- Exact next action: perform an inspect-only environment reconciliation that records current env/sync/deploy truth, key names only, and safe/forbidden command boundaries.
- Blocker rule: if key names cannot be safely determined without exposing values, mark this item `Blocked` and ask Mike to provide a redacted key-name list.

Environment Safety Findings:

- Inspection date: 2026-06-23.
- Worktree at inspection start: clean.
- `package.json` script classification:
  - Safe local verification:
    - `lint`: TypeScript compile check; no cloud write expected.
    - `test`: Vitest run; no cloud write expected unless future tests add live-cloud behavior.
    - `build`: local Next build through build-info wrapper; no deploy.
    - `vercel:build`: runs the same build command; no Vercel deploy.
  - Caution-required:
    - `dev`: starts local app; UI paths can write to Supabase if env points at a configured target.
    - `start`: starts built app; UI paths can write to Supabase if env points at a configured target.
    - `start:lan`: exposes built app on LAN; UI paths can write to Supabase if env points at a configured target.
    - `ios:test`: builds and starts LAN server; useful for validation but can expose write-capable app flows.
  - Forbidden without explicit approval:
    - No package script directly runs deploy, migration, seed, or backfill.
    - Any future `vercel deploy`, Supabase CLI write, SQL migration, seed, backfill, production smoke write, or command requiring production credentials is forbidden until explicitly approved.
- Supabase/Vercel/env references found:
  - `lib/supabase/client.ts`: creates browser Supabase client from public env keys.
  - `lib/storage/completedSessionRepository.ts`: upserts athlete and inserts completed session snapshots into `session_logs`; reads `session_logs`.
  - `lib/storage/externalLoadRepository.ts`: upserts athlete and inserts Sport Load snapshots into `session_logs`; reads `session_logs`.
  - `lib/storage/cloudKpiRepository.ts`: upserts athlete, inserts standalone KPI snapshots and tombstone delete snapshots into `session_logs`; reads `session_logs`.
  - `lib/storage/cloudSessionProgressRepository.ts`: upserts athlete and upserts live session progress into `session_progress`; reads `session_progress`.
  - `lib/storage/localSessionRepository.ts`, `lib/storage/localKpiRepository.ts`, `app/history/page.tsx`, `components/SessionDebugClient.tsx`: local delete paths only; no Supabase delete path observed.
  - `supabase/schema.sql`: schema/RLS/grants SQL; migration-class file, forbidden to apply without explicit approval and target confirmation.
  - `scripts/env-whoami.mjs`: reads env key names/values internally to classify target and prints host/classification; safe only when target disclosure is acceptable.
  - `scripts/confirm-write-target.mjs`: read-only confirmation gate; performs no writes.
  - `scripts/preflight.mjs`: read-only summary but invokes `env-whoami`; can reveal target classification/host.
  - `scripts/run-with-build-info.mjs`: injects local git SHA into build/dev env; no cloud write.
  - `components/BuildBadge.tsx`: displays public build/deploy metadata.
  - `README.md`, `MIGRATION_NOTES.md`, `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/KPI_CLOUD_SYNC_STAGING_TEST_PLAN.md`, `docs/GOLDEN_FIXTURES_PLAN.md`, `docs/STARTUP.md`: supporting docs with environment, deploy, sync, staging, or production-safety references; not active scope authority.
- Environment key names found, names only:
  - `CONFIRM_PRODUCTION`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`
  - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VERCEL_ENV`
  - `WRITE_ACTION`
  - `WRITE_TARGET`
- Risk classification:
  - Supabase mutation paths exist in repositories through `upsert`/`insert` to `athletes`, `session_logs`, and `session_progress`.
  - No client physical Supabase delete path was observed; standalone KPI delete uses an inserted tombstone snapshot.
  - Applying `supabase/schema.sql` is a migration/write operation and forbidden without explicit target confirmation.
  - Starting the app is caution-required because user interaction can create cloud writes if env points at a configured Supabase target.
  - Vercel deploy is not present as a package script, but any deploy command or push intended to deploy remains forbidden without explicit approval.
  - `.env.local` and env backup files were not read; key names were discovered from code/docs only.

### ENV-PREVIEW-DB-001

- ID: ENV-PREVIEW-DB-001
- Title: Vercel Preview Supabase environment is unverified / may be sharing production-like KPI data
- Type: Defect
- Parent: Data integrity / production safety
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Docs-only / environment-safety
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Vercel Preview smoke after `1c336a0`
- Problem: Vercel Preview deployment for branch `preprod/kpi-protocols-2026-06-30` showed badge `1c336a0 · preview`, and Preview `/kpis` displayed existing KPI results/baselines similar to production. Mike later confirmed Preview points to production Supabase through Vercel variables scoped to "All Environments."
- Desired outcome: Preview database target is verified before any Preview write testing.
- In scope: docs capture of unverified risk, no-write operational rule, and verification task.
- Out of scope: env var changes, Vercel configuration changes, Supabase changes, app code, tests, deploys, or writes.
- Acceptance criteria: Met. Fresh Preview is verified against staging; historical pre-split Preview deployments remain unsafe for write testing.
- Dependencies: Vercel environment variable inspection or safe runtime evidence that does not expose secret values.
- Risks: Preview KPI saves or other write flows could mutate production data if Preview env vars point to production Supabase.
- Next action: Resolved. Use only fresh/current Preview deployments for staging tests and retain target checks before any write-capable QA.
- Links / evidence: historical Preview badge `1c336a0 · preview`; Mike Vercel settings correction; fresh Preview proof `0794f70` on 2026-08-21.

### ENV-PREVIEW-DB-AUDIT-001

- ID: ENV-PREVIEW-DB-AUDIT-001
- Title: Verify Vercel Preview Supabase target
- Type: Task
- Parent: ENV-PREVIEW-DB-001
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Docs-only / environment-safety
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: ENV-PREVIEW-DB-001
- Problem: Preview DB isolation cannot be assumed from visible KPI data or build badge alone.
- Desired outcome: determine whether Production, Preview, and local development use separate Supabase project refs without exposing secret values.
- In scope: verify Supabase project refs/URLs by redacted Vercel env var review, safe non-secret runtime evidence, or approved read-only environment confirmation.
- Out of scope: changing env vars, changing Vercel config, changing Supabase, running writes, migrations, schema changes, or deploys.
- Acceptance criteria: answers are captured for all required verification questions; Preview writes are either allowed only against staging/non-production or explicitly disabled/treated read-only.
- Dependencies: access to Vercel env configuration or safe runtime target labeling.
- Risks: exposing secrets while verifying, or testing writes before target isolation is known.
- Next action: Resolved; retain target verification before write-capable Preview QA and never reuse historical pre-split Preview deployments.
- Links / evidence: `scripts/env-whoami.mjs`, `scripts/preflight.mjs`, `scripts/confirm-write-target.mjs`, Vercel project env settings, fresh Preview proof `0794f70`.

Required verification questions:

- What Supabase URL/project ref is configured for Vercel Production?
  - Confirmed: `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko`.
- What Supabase URL/project ref is configured for Vercel Preview?
  - Confirmed current mapping: `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz` (staging); fresh Preview build proof passed on 2026-08-21.
- What Supabase URL/project ref is configured for Vercel Development?
  - Confirmed current mapping: `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz` (staging).
- What Supabase URL/project ref is configured locally in `.env.local`?
  - Confirmed: `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`.
- Are Preview and Production using different Supabase project refs?
  - Confirmed: yes. Production uses `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko`; fresh Preview uses `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`.
- Does the app expose a safe non-secret environment/build indicator?
  - Yes for Vercel environment/build SHA; the 2026-08-21 verification additionally proved the non-secret Supabase project ref during build.
- Should Preview writes require target confirmation?
  - Yes. Current Preview isolation is proven, but any write-capable QA must still confirm it is a fresh/current Preview targeting staging and must never target Production.

Operational rule:

- Current Preview/Development configuration is staging-isolated. Historical pre-split Preview deployments remain read-only/unsafe for writes and must not be reused.

### CODE-COMMENT-AUDIT-001

- ID: CODE-COMMENT-AUDIT-001
- Title: Stale Inline Comment / TODO Audit
- Type: Task
- Parent: Scope system hardening
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: External audit / scope hardening
- Problem: old code comments may contain stale instructions that conflict with `docs/SCOPE.md` and confuse future Codex work.
- Desired outcome: code comments that imply scope are either verified against active scope IDs, updated, or removed in a future dedicated comment-cleanup task.
- In scope: inspect comments/TODOs/docstrings in `app`, `components`, `lib`, `scripts`, import adapters, and tests if present.
- Out of scope: behavior changes, refactors, source JSON edits, package installs, Supabase writes.
- Acceptance criteria: produce a list of stale/suspicious comments and recommended action; no behavior changes.
- Dependencies: `docs/SCOPE.md` remains the only active scope authority.
- Risks: stale implementation notes may be mistaken for planned product work.
- Next action: Completed; revisit only if new stale TODO/comment risk is discovered.
- Links / evidence: targeted comment-risk scan from this docs-only hardening task.

Known comment-risk findings:

- `components/SessionMinimalDiagnostic.tsx:13`: low risk. Comment says `Fall through to the older-browser-safe id.` This appears to describe an implementation fallback, not scope. Recommended action: verify during the future audit; keep only if still accurate.
- No `tests/` directory was present during the initial scan.

### ACTIVITY-PRESCRIPTION-001

- ID: ACTIVITY-PRESCRIPTION-001
- Title: Activity Prescription Display Layer
- Type: Feature
- Parent: Training system
- Priority: P1
- Status: Blocked
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: v8.4 import package and Activity Prescription intake
- Problem: Athlete-actionable cards can hide available sets/reps/time/rest/tempo/source/cue detail.
- Desired outcome: Maddox can open planned work and understand exactly what to do from approved source metadata.
- In scope: render existing v8.4 prescription fields, honest missing-source states, instruction/video status if available.
- Out of scope: source JSON edits, invented prescriptions, logging field changes, Supabase/schema changes.
- Acceptance criteria: available prescription detail appears in Day/Session activity cards; missing data is identified honestly.
- Dependencies: `FORENSIC-DAY-SESSION-MISMATCH-001`; `SURFACE-PRESENTATION-CONSUMER-AUDIT-001`; v8.4 metadata/loaders/components.
- Risks: current uncommitted WIP may contain surface-specific fixes that do not solve the shared Day/Session architecture.
- Next action: stop cosmetic display patching; implement the approved planned-activity presentation contract for Day + Session parity only before revising current WIP for broader surfaces.
- Links / evidence: `imports/v8.4/data/`, prior training epics content merged here; use git history only.

Current WIP gate:

- ACTIVITY-PRESCRIPTION-001A/B/C WIP is not commit-ready.
- Browser QA on June 19 found Day/Session presentation divergence, missing loggable steps, title/duration conflicts, and stale Session form copy.
- Do not mark product accepted.
- Do not commit current WIP until DEF-021 through DEF-027 are addressed or dispositioned through an approved fix plan.
- No further cosmetic display patches are allowed until the forensic Day/Session data-flow audit and site-wide consumer audit identify the canonical projection layer, affected consumers, and WIP disposition.

### FORENSIC-DAY-SESSION-MISMATCH-001

- ID: FORENSIC-DAY-SESSION-MISMATCH-001
- Title: Forensic Day/Session data-flow audit
- Type: Task
- Parent: ACTIVITY-PRESCRIPTION-001
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: June 19 browser QA during ACTIVITY-PRESCRIPTION-001A/B/C
- Problem: Day page and Session form render different activity labels, planned steps, durations, and instructions for the same date/session.
- Desired outcome: identify the exact data-flow mismatch before more implementation work, then approve a fix plan that creates one canonical activity presentation contract.
- In scope: inspect Day page source path, Session form source path, step projection, duration/title derivation, shared helper usage, current WIP disposition, and tests needed for parity.
- Out of scope: fixing app code, editing v8.4 JSON, changing logging behavior, Supabase/schema changes, package changes, browser automation.
- Acceptance criteria: audit documents Day path, Session path, why steps differ, why duration/title conflict occurs, which canonical projection layer both must use, and which WIP changes should be kept, revised, or reverted.
- Dependencies: current uncommitted ACTIVITY-PRESCRIPTION WIP; v8.4 import package.
- Risks: applying more display patches before this audit may hide architectural defects and increase divergence.
- Next action: use the completed forensic and site-wide consumer audit findings to guide `ACTIVITY-PRESENTATION-CONTRACT-001`.
- Links / evidence: DEF-021 through DEF-026; Mike June 19 browser QA.

### SURFACE-PRESENTATION-CONSUMER-AUDIT-001

- ID: SURFACE-PRESENTATION-CONSUMER-AUDIT-001
- Title: Site-wide activity presentation consumer audit
- Type: Task
- Parent: ACTIVITY-PRESCRIPTION-001
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Mike review after FORENSIC-DAY-SESSION-MISMATCH-001
- Problem: Day and Session already diverged, and similar display/data drift may exist anywhere the app renders plan/activity/session labels, durations, instructions, source labels, or logging representations.
- Desired outcome: identify every consumer of plan/activity/session display data and produce a wiring plan for the canonical activity presentation contract.
- In scope: inspect routes, components, adapters, projections, repositories, exports, reports, and helpers that render plan, day, session, drill, activity, sport-load, recovery, IQ, shooting, conditioning, Speed Stack, source-block, or logging labels.
- Out of scope: app-code fixes, test edits, source JSON edits, logging behavior changes, Supabase/schema changes, package changes, browser automation.
- Acceptance criteria: every athlete-facing consumer is identified and classified as must consume canonical activity presentation contract now, can consume summary projection from the same contract, admin/source/reference-only exception, or deferred with explicit rationale.
- Dependencies: FORENSIC-DAY-SESSION-MISMATCH-001; current uncommitted ACTIVITY-PRESCRIPTION WIP; v8.4 import package.
- Risks: without this audit, fixes may continue as surface-specific cosmetic patches and create new drift across Calendar, Dashboard, History, Today, Library, exports, and reports.
- Next action: use completed audit findings to implement `ACTIVITY-PRESENTATION-CONTRACT-001` as a Day + Session planned-activity parity slice only.
- Links / evidence: DEF-027; FORENSIC-DAY-SESSION-MISMATCH-001 report; inspect-only SURFACE-PRESENTATION-CONSUMER-AUDIT-001 report; Mike review.

Completed audit conclusions:

- The Day page is closest to canonical because it uses `dayExecutionPlan` plus `buildDayPresentation`.
- The Session page is the main divergent path because it builds a synthetic flattened workout/drill model from `sessions.json` and `drills.json`.
- Site-wide presentation consumers exist across Day, Session, Today/Home, Calendar, Training Work, Sport Load, Dashboard, History, Library, Plan, KPIs, Exports, storage snapshots, and debug/reference surfaces.
- Site-wide consumers must be classified before broad fixes: canonical-contract-now, summary-from-contract, admin/source/reference-only exception, or deferred with explicit rationale.
- Current ACTIVITY-PRESCRIPTION-001A/B/C WIP remains intentionally uncommitted and not commit-ready.

Consumer classification summary:

- Must consume canonical activity presentation contract now: Day execution, Session form/cards/summary, Training Work logging surface, and the v8.4 session adapter path that currently synthesizes workout/drill display.
- Can consume summary projection from the same contract: Today/Home, Calendar, Dashboard, History, DayEvidenceStatus, Plan summaries, KPI day summaries, Sport Load support-work summaries, and future exports/reports.
- Admin/source/reference-only exceptions: Library source catalog and debug/diagnostic session surfaces, as long as they are not used as athlete execution UI.
- Deferred with rationale: broad Dashboard/History/KPI/Exports rewiring until Day + Session parity is stable and product-reviewed.

Approved architecture direction:

- v8.4 `dayExecutionPlan` owns top-level day activity coverage and order.
- `sessions.json` and `drills.json` enrich details but must not replace top-level planned day order.
- Speed Stack child drills attach under parent Speed Stack activities.
- Duration precedence is `dayExecutionPlan` first, session/drill detail second, code-derived fallback only when no authoritative duration exists and no conflict is present.
- Presentation fixes must not mutate saved data.
- Implementation is not product-accepted until Mike completes future browser/product QA.

Split-pass implementation strategy:

- Pass 1, immediate: `projectPlannedDayActivities(date)`. Scope is master/reference plan data plus metadata only. No Supabase, no saved logs, no transactional joins.
- Pass 2, deferred: `projectDayEvidence(date)`. Scope is saved evidence/status/logs only.
- Pass 3, deferred: `composeDayViewModel(date)`. Scope is composition of planned presentation plus evidence.

Documentation-only target baseline:

```ts

  id: string;
  date: string;
  sequenceOrder: number;

  sourceBlockId?: string;
  sourceTrace?: {
    dayExecutionPlanId?: string;

### ACTIVITY-PRESENTATION-CONTRACT-001

- ID: ACTIVITY-PRESENTATION-CONTRACT-001
- Title: Planned activity presentation contract, Day + Session parity only
- Type: Task
- Parent: ACTIVITY-PRESCRIPTION-001
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Completed SURFACE-PRESENTATION-CONSUMER-AUDIT-001
- Problem: Day and Session did not consume one canonical planned-activity presentation model, causing missing planned steps, stale source language, and duration/title conflicts.
- Desired outcome: Day and Session render planned activities from one `projectPlannedDayActivities(date)` contract while preserving raw IDs and avoiding saved-data mutation.
- In scope: completed Pass 1 only; derived top-level planned activity presentation from v8.4 `dayExecutionPlan`; enriched with session/drill metadata where available; attached Speed Stack child drills under parent Speed Stack activities; wired Day + Session parity; added focused tests for planned-step parity, duration precedence, and source-language filtering.
- Out of scope: Supabase, saved logs, transactional joins, Dashboard, History, KPI, Exports, Gantt, source JSON edits, logging schema changes, broad redesign, product acceptance claims.
- Acceptance criteria: Day and Session use the same planned-activity contract; Warmup, Speed Stack, controlled bike/treadmill, shooting, IQ, cooldown/mobility, readiness, and reflection are represented or classified; athlete-facing labels do not leak known source/workbook language; duration labels follow authoritative precedence.
- Dependencies: completed `FORENSIC-DAY-SESSION-MISMATCH-001`; completed `SURFACE-PRESENTATION-CONSUMER-AUDIT-001`; v8.4 import package.
- Risks: expanding the first pass into evidence/log composition could change logging behavior or saved data; overfitting June 19 could leave site-wide drift unresolved.
- Next action: broader surfaces remain separate future stabilization; do not expand into Dashboard, History, KPI, Calendar, Exports, or Gantt without a new approved loop.
- Links / evidence: commits `c20432c` and `05019f5`; DEF-021 through DEF-027; completed consumer audit; current uncommitted ACTIVITY-PRESCRIPTION-001A/B/C WIP.

Ground Truth Baseline:

- Do not invent TypeScript props.
- Do not assume Gemini's proposed interface is correct.
- Future implementation must map observed v8.4 keys to UI fields without editing v8.4 JSON.
- If source files or keys are not found during implementation, mark this item `Blocked` or `Scope review required` with a next action to inspect the actual import model.

- Type: Task
- Parent: Day-first architecture
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Calendar coverage acceptance and DPM-QA follow-up
- Problem: Calendar/date coverage is fixed, but upcoming day usability still needs QA.
- Desired outcome: future days load, communicate day type, show executable content when planned, and avoid misleading statuses.
- In scope: inspect Day/Calendar/Session projections for upcoming dates; add narrow fixes only if requested.
- Out of scope: source-plan rewrite, broad redesign, Playwright unless separately approved.
- Acceptance criteria: all 96 v8.4 plan dates from `2026-06-15` through `2026-09-18` project athlete-usable Day readiness with nonblank titles, guidance, visible planned elements, and forbidden source/internal label filtering.
- Dependencies: Activity Prescription may expose more day usability gaps.
- Risks: source gaps may be confused with app projection gaps.
- Next action: maintain as regression proof before broader Day/Calendar/Session readiness work.
- Links / evidence: Calendar date coverage commit `7b48a3e`; automated proof commit `6ab3f5e`.

- Type: Feature
- Parent: Evidence model
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed locally
- Lane: Safe lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Friday readiness QA and training log observations
- Problem: Generic logging may not capture useful evidence for shots, stickhandling, readiness, or specific work types.
- Desired outcome: logging fields reflect planned activities without creating duplicate logging systems.
- In scope: one date-level logging experience with readiness, activity results, KPI handoff, Sport Load fields, and reflection while preserving repository boundaries.
- Out of scope: immediate schema changes, production writes, separate workaround logging systems.
- Acceptance criteria: field design is reviewed before implementation; Sport Load and Training Work evidence remain separate.
- Dependencies: Activity Prescription Display Layer and evidence model review.
- Risks: premature logging changes could corrupt evidence semantics.
- Next action: validate the unified date-level logging route and obtain parent visual acceptance.

- Source: Day Presentation Model and Friday QA
- Problem: Day sequence and Session execution could drift, confusing the athlete about the real plan.
- Desired outcome: Day planned sequence and execution session cards represent the same approved work.
- In scope: projection parity, card ordering, links/actions.
- Out of scope: source training edits and logging schema changes.
- Acceptance criteria: planned blocks visible on Day are represented in execution flow where applicable.
- Dependencies: Activity Prescription layer.
- Risks: source-plan title/block mismatches need source-review instead of UI masking.
- Next action: maintain this proof as the guardrail before broader surface work.
- Links / evidence: `app/day/[date]/page.tsx`, session components, commits `c20432c` and `05019f5`.

### PLAN-CONTENT-001

- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Parent-approved forward plan cutover on 2026-08-13; parent-confirmed Week 9 Sport Load correction on 2026-08-15
- Problem: Some day titles may imply work that is not represented in executable blocks.
- Desired outcome: source-plan mismatches are identified honestly and resolved through approved source-update process.
- In scope: replace contradictory future rows from 2026-08-14 through 2026-09-06, retain fixed Sport Loads and locked phase/Gantt truth, and verify exact source prescriptions.
- Out of scope: silent content invention or source JSON edits without explicit approval.
- Acceptance criteria: Aug 14 is Marc O’Connor Ice only at 90 minutes; Aug 15 Marc is 120 minutes; Aug 16 contains one 60-minute Marc load plus the unchanged scheduled 4v4; no displaced work becomes training debt.
- Dependencies: v8.4 source package and Mike approval for any source update.
- Risks: UI workarounds could hide real data-integrity issues.
- Findings: the forward generator omitted the Aug 14 Marc O’Connor load and retained stale/non-duration Marc details for Aug 15-16. The local correction replaces Aug 14 training work with one 90-minute Marc Sport Load, sets Aug 15 to 120 minutes, and sets Aug 16 Marc to 60 minutes without changing its 4v4 source row.
- Next action: Maintain the released forward-plan integrity tests; future schedule changes require a new parent-approved source update.
- Links / evidence: v8.4 dayExecutionPlan/session data; Production release chain through `38a2751`.

### PLAN-TRYOUT-EXTENSION-2026-001

- ID: PLAN-TRYOUT-EXTENSION-2026-001
- Title: Late-August Ice / Pathway / U12B Tryout Plan Extension
- Type: Source Review
- Parent: PLAN-CONTENT-001
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Source-review -> Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Parent-confirmed future schedule and explicit v8.4 source-update authorization on 2026-08-19.
- Problem: v8.4 ends on Sep 6, contains a stale Sep 1 tryout assumption, and does not include confirmed late-August Marc ice, Aug 30 4v4, Sep 5-6 Marc ice, Sep 7-11 Pathway, or Sep 12-18 U12B tryout events.
- Desired outcome: one canonical Day truth from Aug 22 through Sep 18, with confirmed Sport Loads rendered once and no hard workout appended on primary Sport Load or between-tryout recovery days.
- In scope: reconcile approved Sport Loads from Aug 22 through Sep 18; remove the Sep 1 tryout; reconcile Aug 31-Sep 4 roles; extend canonical Day, session, Calendar, and required Plan/Gantt date/week coverage; add focused regression coverage and update legitimate import counts.
- Out of scope: Supabase writes, production mutation, schema/KPI/log-stream changes, AI Coach, methodology redesign, unrelated surface redesign, invented exercises, dates on or before 2026-08-19, commit, push, or deploy.
- Acceptance criteria: confirmed late-August and Sep Sport Loads render exactly once; no Sep 1 tryout remains; every Sep 7-18 date has a meaningful canonical Day state; conditional tryout sessions are visible as conditional; Sport Load and Training Work evidence remain separate; required verification passes.
- Dependencies: v8.4 source package, existing approved drill library, `DEC-FORWARD-PLAN-001`, `DEC-SPORTLOAD-001`, `DEC-RECOVERY-001`.
- Risks: stale hard-coded Sep 6/84-date assumptions or forward-plan rules could hide valid extended dates; assigned Sep 12 Skills attendance remains unknown.
- Next action: Maintain the Sep 18 forward integrity/browser coverage; any new tryout/schedule changes require a separately approved source update.
- Links / evidence: `imports/v8.4/data/`, `lib/imports/v8_4/`, `lib/projections/forwardPlanIntegrity.ts`, Production Calendar through Sep 18.

- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Source-review
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Parent product-trust observation for 2026-08-19.
- Problem: Full-Speed Weave with Scan, Read-React Puck Carry, and Sprint-In Shot do not make the space/environment requirement clear enough for basement execution.
- Desired outcome: source review determines an approved environment-fit presentation or regression without Codex inventing training content.
- In scope: source-backed presentation of existing equipment/space and setup requirements; no invented substitute drill.
- Out of scope: changing the Aug 19 training plan, inventing a basement regression, or editing approved source JSON.
- Acceptance criteria: athlete-facing drill detail exposes source-backed space/equipment requirements; `Sprint-In Shot` visibly requires a `10–15 yd lane, puck, net`; no fabricated substitute appears.
- Dependencies: parent/coach-approved drill library guidance.
- Risks: an invented regression would violate source authority and could misrepresent safe execution.
- Next action: Maintain the regression; add a substitute only if a parent/coach-approved source explicitly supplies one.

- Source: Plan coverage audit and product decision
- Problem: Recovery days must be intentional, not blank.
- Desired outcome: appropriate recovery days include easy mobility, low-intensity skill, light cardio, cognitive work, and reflection when approved by source.
- In scope: source-review model, intensity guardrails, app representation of approved recovery prescriptions.
- Out of scope: invented workouts and silent hard conditioning.
- Acceptance criteria: recovery days show intentional low-intensity work or explicit source deferral.
- Dependencies: v8.4/source-review process.
- Risks: adding content without source approval could change the training plan.
- Next action: review recovery-related source data and gaps.
- Links / evidence: prior training epics content merged here; use git history only.

### KPI-ROADMAP-001

- Parent: KPI system
- Priority: P1
- Status: In progress
- Lane: Safe lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: KPI roadmap reconciliation
- Problem: KPI scope, sync status, and future tests had conflicting documentation.
- Desired outcome: KPI roadmap is preserved while implementation waits for sync/model safety.
- In scope: initial KPI tests, advanced KPI candidates, KPI decisions, source-review of backfill/sync status.
- Out of scope: production backfill, stash application, schema changes, implementation without explicit task.
- Acceptance criteria: advanced KPI scope remains available here and future work uses personal trends, not adult standards.
- Dependencies: Environment/data safety reconciliation.
- Risks: stale cloud-sync assumptions could cause production data risk.
- Next action: reconcile KPI sync/backfill docs before any KPI implementation.
- Links / evidence: prior KPI roadmap content merged here; use git history only, `stash@{0}`.

Advanced KPI scope:

- 100m sprint
- 45-second hockey shift simulation / repeated shuttle
- push-up test
- pull-up or flexed-arm hang
- vertical jump
- optional bike power / repeated-effort test later
- shooting accuracy trend
- head-up callout / scan-and-handle trend
- puck-control weave trend with deferred state
- decision: do not use flat 400m as primary hockey-shift test
- decision: compare Maddox against himself over time, not adult/NHL standards

- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed locally
- Lane: Safe lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Parent product QA on 2026-08-13
- Problem: `/kpis` used stale legacy dates while Day/Log represented a partial retest battery.
- Desired outcome: all KPI surfaces derive next-test truth from the canonical v8.4 executable KPI entry and `/log/2026-08-20` directly renders all 14 tests.
- In scope: canonical schedule projection, 14-item source entry, direct logging UX, explicit deferred/not-tested reason.
- Out of scope: historical KPI result edits, Supabase writes, schema migration, illness rescheduling.
- Acceptance criteria: all 14 active KPIs show Aug 20 before completion; the Aug 20 log route contains 14 test forms and no generic KPI-workout handoff.
- Dependencies: existing KPI registry and result repository.
- Risks: future completed-test scheduling needs an evidence-aware next-occurrence rule.

- Source: Parent QA example `Use the referenced approved source drill/module. Quality first.`
- Problem: generated forward source notes leaked placeholder copy into athlete execution.
- Desired outcome: approved structured details render when present; absent detail renders no invented fallback and remains an explicit content gap.
- In scope: remove filler, resolve imported detail children, completeness diagnostics.
- Out of scope: invented drills, instructions, or plan changes.
- Acceptance criteria: filler wording is absent from source projection and forward Day/Log routes.
- Dependencies: v8.4 detail libraries.
- Risks: omission can expose genuine source gaps, which must stay visible in diagnostics.
- Next action: parent acceptance and continued content-gap review.

- Parent: PLAN-CONTENT-001
- Priority: P2
- Status: In progress
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Aug 14-Sep 6 content-completeness audit
- Problem: approved high-level activities resolve exercise detail, but seven detail records still have no parent-approved video mapping.
- Desired outcome: every executable activity has approved actionable detail and each supported exercise has a reviewed exact video mapping.
- In scope: deterministic completeness matrix, honest CONTENT GAP / VIDEO GAP states, approved mapping reuse.
- Out of scope: invented content, invented URLs, vaguely similar substitutes.
- Acceptance criteria: matrix remains current; unresolved gaps are explicit; no fake video control renders.
- Dependencies: parent research/review of the remaining video gaps.
- Risks: a high-level name and time budget can be mistaken for a complete prescription.
- Findings: parent approved and Codex mapped exactly seven stable IDs: `SKL-HU-002`, `SKL-HU-003`, `SKL-GS-002`, `SKL-DEKE-003`, `SHOT-GAME-002`, `SHOT-QR-001`, and `SHOT-ANGLE-001`.

- Problem: Day-first projection behavior needs durable fixtures and acceptance docs.
- Desired outcome: Today, Calendar, History, Dashboard, KPIs, and Exports can be validated against canonical Day evidence.
- In scope: fixture definitions, acceptance docs, projection rules.
- Out of scope: broad app refactor unless separately tasked.
- Acceptance criteria: critical day scenarios are fixture-backed and traceable.
- Dependencies: stable Day projection model.
- Risks: tests may encode stale behavior if written before projection reconciliation.

- In scope: release gate, fixture strategy, test status reconciliation, Playwright plan, QA contract kernel, testing pyramid, test generation rules, and matrix-bloat controls.
- Out of scope: installing Playwright or new tooling without explicit task.
- Acceptance criteria: QA docs reflect current tooling, define release checks by risk level, and require tests to trace to contracts/requirements/defects/scope items.
- Dependencies: current projection model and environment safety.
- Risks: stale QA docs can misstate coverage; giant matrices can obscure missing source inspection.

- Source: Completed-session presentation defect and local QA harness limits
- Problem: Manual browser QA was finding presentation regressions that static HTTP checks could not fully cover, including completed-session/read-only flows.
- Desired outcome: Add the smallest approved Playwright proof-of-life that verifies the June 19 Day + Session title/context flow without saving, finishing, mutating production data, or relying on Mike as the only QA harness.
- In scope: package install, local proof-of-life spec, production/read-only navigation, artifact capture, and explicit no-save/no-finish guardrails.
- Out of scope: broad Playwright rollout, CI changes, bundled browser downloads, app code fixes, Supabase writes, data backfills, migrations, or saved-record mutation.
- Acceptance criteria: Playwright launches installed Chrome on Catalina, opens production Day and Session routes, verifies Day title/badge, safely handles absent previous-attempt gate, and does not click Finish/Save/Submit/Start Fresh/logging actions.
- Dependencies: macOS 10.15.8 Catalina; installed Google Chrome; current no-package QA harness; DEF-028.
- Risks: production session data state can change, so previous-attempt/completed-session branch may not appear in every run.
- Next action: keep Playwright expansion deferred until deterministic fixtures are approved; DEF-028 display behavior is covered by component-level automated proof.
- Links / evidence: Playwright proof-of-life code commit `402edc8`; DEF-028 evidence logging script commit `66ab959`; DEF-028 fix and component proof commit `9fd4c73`; all-date Day/Session parity proof commit `05019f5`.

- In scope: inspect `package.json` test scripts, existing test files, existing fixture files, and v8.4 import data structure; recommend a single fixture location; create dummy/sanitized v8.4-shaped fixtures only in a later approved implementation task.
- Out of scope: package installs, Playwright setup, app behavior changes, Supabase writes, v8.4 JSON edits, production data, real athlete data in fixtures.
- Acceptance criteria: future task identifies the current test convention, creates or confirms fixture directory, adds sanitized fixture data, and wires validation without changing production behavior.
- Dependencies: `docs/SCOPE.md`, v8.4 import package, `package.json` test scripts.
- Risks: creating fixtures from real data, creating parallel test conventions, or adding test tooling before scope approval.
- Next action: inspect-only QA fixture discovery before or alongside the first Activity Prescription implementation task.
- Links / evidence: previous comment-risk scan found no top-level `tests/` directory; this is not proof that no tests exist elsewhere.

### GOV-PO-AGENT-001

- ID: GOV-PO-AGENT-001
- Title: Project Owner Intelligence & Portfolio Governance Agent
- Type: Epic / Feature
- Parent: Project governance / Agentic workflow
- Priority: P1
- Status: In progress
- Lane: Safe lane / governance architecture
- Owner: Mike / ChatGPT orchestration / Codex implementation
- Source: Parent conceptual/functional approval 2026-08-22; Product Owner Technical Design v1 approval 2026-08-23; GitHub Issue #8.
- Problem: Portfolio truth, prioritization, dependencies, scoring evidence, release evidence, and governance are distributed across project sources. Missing metadata is difficult to assess consistently, and portfolio decisions can become dependent on chat interpretation.
- Desired outcome: Create an evidence-backed conversational Product Owner intelligence layer that gathers project evidence; distinguishes facts from assessments; proposes missing portfolio metadata; scores scope using explicit rubrics; analyzes dependencies and sequencing; identifies stale or misaligned scope; supports scenario planning; challenges PO assumptions constructively; creates structured proposed scope mutations; maintains Working versus Canonical state; generates auditable Change Sets; and preserves human Product Owner authority.
- In scope:
  - Truth/provenance classes: Observed fact; Deterministically derived fact; Agent assessment; PO-approved decision. Agent assessments must never be presented as observed facts.
  - Evidence records containing value, state, provenance, evidence refs, rationale, confidence, assessment version/date, approval state, and uncertainties/contradictions. `Not Scored` triggers evidence investigation: propose an evidence-backed score or identify the exact missing evidence and resolution path.
  - Approved anchored 1-5 dimensions: Business/User Value; Time Criticality; Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement; Job Size / Effort; Complexity; Data Readiness; Blast Radius; Technical Risk; Dependency Criticality; Evaluation Readiness; Confidence; and Agentic Loop Stage / MVL role. No scores are assigned by this scope capture.
  - Deterministic WSJF only when every required value exists: `(Business/User Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement) / Job Size`. Expose inputs and provenance; use no hidden defaults.
  - Directed, typed, evidence-backed dependencies: blocks / blocked by; requires / required by; parent / child; supersedes / superseded by; relates to. Do not infer arbitrary relationships; only blocking/requirement relationships affect sequencing calculations.
  - Agentic/MVL model: Foundation beneath `Perceive -> Reason -> Act -> Learn/Feedback`, with Guardrails/Evaluation cross-cutting. Future agentic scope is not implementation-ready when required loop stages, evaluation, or guardrails are absent.
  - Persistent, in-context PO conversation while reviewing scope, visualizations, architecture, selected scope items, dependency subgraphs, and reconciliation queues. The agent explains, compares, recommends, challenges, and proposes changes while the human PO retains final authority.
  - Three distinct states: Canonical repo state; Agent recommendation; Working PO state. Working state may deterministically recalculate affected views and scenarios but remains visibly proposed/uncommitted and cannot silently change Canonical state.
  - Structured mutations with, at minimum: mutation ID; scope ID; field/path; canonical value; proposed value; rationale; evidence refs; confidence; provenance class; actor; affected records/files; guardrail impact; downstream recalculation; and state. Conversational commands must not become hidden free-form Markdown edits.
  - A visible session Change Ledger that consolidates reviewed mutations into one coherent Change Set, rather than one PR per conversational edit. Support revision, individual/group undo, and reset to Canonical state.
  - Persistence contract: Working state -> reviewed Change Set -> explicit PO approval -> validated branch -> deterministic Markdown patch -> PR -> normal merge/release governance. No direct `main` mutation.
  - Constructive PO challenge behavior that surfaces conflicts, tradeoffs, uncertainties, alternatives, and approval needs rather than automatically agreeing.
  - Architecture/Guardrail handoff: the PO Agent owns portfolio/product intelligence; Architecture/Guardrail authority owns architectural legality and safety and may block invalid persistence with evidence and remediation options.
  - Autonomy levels L0 Observe, L1 Analyze, L2 Recommend, L3 Draft validated change set, L4 controlled branch/PR execution after authorization, and L5 autonomous canonical mutation. Initial target is L2 plus gated L3; L5 is not approved.
  - A golden PO Agent evaluation suite covering evidence/citation correctness; scoring consistency and unsupported scoring; hallucinated/missed dependencies; stale-scope and alignment detection; architecture/guardrail compliance; unsafe-action escalation; recommendation/tradeoff quality; mutation correctness; Canonical/Working isolation; Markdown patch targeting; and human-approval escalation.
  - Approved Technical Design v1 decisions: use the existing Next.js/TypeScript server runtime; use the OpenAI Agents SDK for TypeScript server-side; expose typed function tools only, with no shell, `apply_patch`, or generic filesystem tool; use a deterministic SCOPE parser and Markdown patcher; overlay Working Portfolio state on an immutable Canonical snapshot; keep governance/session data separate from athlete training tables; do not require Admin authentication for the current private-family deployment; defer Supabase Auth until broader-go-live hardening; use an eventual least-privilege server-side GitHub integration for GitHub writes; and complete deterministic foundations plus the evaluation harness before gated L3 writes.
  - Current private-use Admin access decision: the Admin/PO Console is not linked from athlete-facing navigation and may use an unlinked route known to the Product Owner. This is private-deployment convenience, not a production-grade authentication boundary. Existing athlete Supabase anon/RLS permissions must not be broadened for Admin functionality, and all GitHub/repository mutation safeguards remain unchanged.
  - Phase A deterministic foundations merged to main at `3f7872d83b8e9ac2d3c423b58681e384a4bd99ad`: typed domain/evidence/provenance/mutation models; deterministic supplied-text SCOPE parser with diagnostics and source-revision metadata; portfolio, score, dependency, and mutation validation; 1-5 score validation and explicit-input WSJF; typed dependency graph traversal/cycle detection; immutable Working Portfolio overlays; deterministic affected-fact recalculation; and focused Vitest fixtures including current canonical-record resolution.
  - Phase B implemented, locally validated, and Product Owner live-acceptance passed: server-only canonical portfolio loader; eleven typed read-only portfolio tools; OpenAI Agents SDK server orchestration with no write-capable tools; evidence-authority/contradiction policy; validated read-only API boundary; ten structured golden evaluation scenarios with deterministic graders; safe response rendering; token/estimated-cost observability; and an unlinked `Project Owner Lab` engineering surface. The PO Lab is Phase B read-only interaction/testing infrastructure, not `ADMIN-PROJECT-OWNER-CONSOLE-001` implementation. The paid agent endpoint fails closed in Preview and Production unless `PO_AGENT_ENABLED=true` is explicitly configured server-side; this enablement gate does not replace the deferred broader-go-live authentication requirement.
  - Phase B deterministic next-work regression resolved: the first live question, "What should we work on next?", exposed that the model could build a stale candidate pool from incomplete lifecycle/sequencing evidence. The corrected read-only candidate engine owns lifecycle eligibility, structured Active Queue / Current Sprint / checkpoint evidence, blocker/dependency state, deterministic ordering, and explicit contradiction propagation. The model explains and compares that result rather than constructing the candidate pool; stale `ENV-SAFETY-LOCAL-PROD-GUARD` cannot displace current executable work.
  - Phase B live acceptance design finding, 2026-08-23: the first corrected live next-work acceptance recommended `DEF-DAY-DURATION-CONTRACT-001` and passed deterministic lifecycle/readiness plus Current Sprint selection. The run used `gpt-5.6-sol` with 27,705 input tokens, 270 output tokens, and 27,975 total tokens. With no cached-input breakdown recorded, the cost is estimated using the reviewed uncached-input rate, not asserted as an exact API charge. Context volume is materially high for a simple PO question; context optimization and multi-model/local-cloud routing are explicitly deferred to `MODEL-ROUTING-001` design and are not part of this Phase B closeout.
  - Phase B capability boundary accepted: canonical portfolio state remains immutable; no canonical write tool, Phase C mutation capability, authentication expansion, Supabase write, or GitHub-write agent capability exists.
- Out of scope: Application implementation in this capture; autonomous canonical mutation; direct `main` writes; scope deletion/rationalization; self-approval of agent assessments; merges; deployments; Production or training-data writes; changes to `imports/v8.4/data/*.json`; bypass of normal design, architecture, safety, or release governance.
- Acceptance criteria: The conceptual/functional contract and Technical Design v1 are PO-approved; evidence/provenance, 1-5 rubric, dependency, three-state, structured mutation, Change Ledger/write-back, Architecture/Guardrail, autonomy, Admin Console integration, and golden-evaluation contracts are accepted and versionable; missing inputs remain explicit; direct-main and L5 mutation remain disabled; Scope.MD Aligned = yes.
- Dependencies: Canonical `docs/SCOPE.md` authority; existing design, architecture, data-integrity, environment, and safety guardrails; `ADMIN-PROJECT-OWNER-CONSOLE-001` consumes this item's intelligence/conversation/governance contracts as its interaction surface.
- Risks: Unsupported assessments could be mistaken for facts; fabricated scores or dependency edges could distort sequencing; Working state could leak into Canonical state; unsafe or ambiguous Markdown targeting could remove or rewrite scope; an agreeable agent could conceal important tradeoffs.
- Next action: Design `MODEL-ROUTING-001` before Phase C. Do not create or implement that scope, begin Phase C mutations, or start `ADMIN-PROJECT-OWNER-CONSOLE-001` as part of the Phase B closeout.

### MODEL-ROUTING-001

- ID: MODEL-ROUTING-001
- Title: Provider-Neutral Intelligence Gateway and Deterministic Model Routing
- Type: Initiative / Feature
- Parent: GOV-PO-AGENT-001 / Intelligence architecture
- Priority: P1
- Status: In progress
- Lane: Safe lane / governance architecture
- Owner: Mike / ChatGPT architecture / Codex implementation
- Source: GitHub Issue #13 conceptual, functional, and Technical Design v0.1 approval; Phase B live acceptance context-volume finding.
- Problem: Product features currently bind intelligence requests directly to a provider/model path, while privacy, capability, approval, health, context, latency, and cost constraints lack one deterministic provider-neutral routing contract.
- Desired outcome: Product/domain code requests an intelligence capability through a typed task contract; a deterministic gateway plans an approved privacy-safe route, explicit fallback, context packet, normalized cost/usage, and provenance without allowing an LLM to select its own route.
- In scope:
  - Conceptual, Functional, and Technical Design v0.1 are approved.
  - MR-A Gateway Foundation is merged to main: provider-neutral task/result, privacy, capability, tier, provider/model registry, task-specific approval, deterministic route-planning, escalation, context-budget, pricing/usage, telemetry, provider-adapter, health, and benchmark/eval contracts.
  - Accepted MR-A hardening: every task has explicit `inferenceRequirement` and `deterministicPathAvailable` inputs; hard cost budgets fail closed, including `cost_unknown_under_hard_limit` when cost cannot be proven; soft budgets remain informational; required evidence cannot be silently omitted and rejects the packet when it alone exceeds budget; provider eligibility uses explicit privacy allowlists.
  - Tier 0 deterministic/no-model decisions and local first-right-of-refusal only when every approval, privacy, capability, health, context, latency, and cost constraint passes.
  - Phase B compatibility: existing PO Agent runtime, model choice, response behavior, PO Lab, and fail-closed deployment gate remain unchanged.
  - MR-B Context, Evidence Packet & Observability Integration is implemented locally, architecture-reviewed, hardening accepted, live packed-path Sol acceptance passed, and ready for commit/PR: conservative deterministic PO task classification; task-specific bounded evidence policy; legacy/shadow/packed modes with legacy default; bounded next-work projection; required-evidence fail-closed behavior; explicit packed fallback; no duplicate unbounded candidate context; and additive estimated/actual context telemetry over the unchanged Sol execution path.
  - MR-B live packed-path acceptance, 2026-08-23: the unchanged `gpt-5.6-sol` OpenAI Agents SDK path recommended `DEF-DAY-DURATION-CONTRACT-001`, retained `TEST-FIXTURE-001` as strongest executable alternative, kept `ENV-SAFETY-LOCAL-PROD-GUARD` reconciliation-required, and made no unsupported canonical claim. `SPORT-SCHEDULE-VERIFY-001` remained deterministically review-only and was not promoted; omission of that non-selected review-only item from general next-work prose is non-material unless evidence policy explicitly requires response coverage. The FIT packet retained all mandatory evidence with zero omissions, one model request, zero tool calls, 3,933 aggregate input tokens, 472 output tokens, and 4,405 total tokens. Against the accepted 27,705-input-token legacy baseline, input fell by 23,772 tokens (85.804%). Provider/model selection remained unchanged.
- Out of scope: GOV-PO-AGENT-001 Phase C; PO Agent provider/model migration; live provider adapters or calls; provider/model benchmark experiments; local-model integration or experiments; Coach runtime/UI; authentication; Supabase/GitHub writes; v8.4 edits; deployment; RAG/vector database; fine-tuning; second backend service.
- Acceptance criteria: MR-A deterministic and privacy/security tests pass; routing plan performs no model call; MR-B retains all mandatory evidence, reports every omission/fallback, adds no shadow inference, avoids duplicate unbounded candidate context in packed mode, preserves deterministic next-work and Phase B/API behavior, and leaves actual-versus-estimated usage explicit; no provider-specific response type escapes adapter contracts; standard app validation and v8.4 verification pass.
- Dependencies: GOV-PO-AGENT-001 Phase B accepted baseline; approved Issue #13 design; architecture review before commit/PR or runtime integration.
- Risks: registry metadata can become stale; model approvals require benchmark evidence; token estimates are pre-call estimates; provider health is supplied state without network probes; future execution adapters must preserve privacy and normalized-result boundaries.
- Next action: Commit, open a PR, pass CI, and merge MR-B. Provider/model benchmark experiments, MR-C, and GOV-PO-AGENT-001 Phase C remain not started.
- Links / evidence: GitHub Issue #13; `GOV-PO-AGENT-001`; `lib/intelligence/`; Phase B live acceptance telemetry recorded above.

### ADMIN-PROJECT-OWNER-CONSOLE-001

- ID: ADMIN-PROJECT-OWNER-CONSOLE-001
- Title: Project Owner / Architecture / Scope Administration Console
- Type: Epic / Feature
- Parent: Project governance / Admin tooling
- Priority: P1
- Status: Not started
- Lane: Safe lane
- Owner: Mike / ChatGPT orchestration / Codex implementation
- Source: Parent approval 2026-08-22; GitHub Issue #7 and approved conversational-PO-workspace comment.
- Problem: Project scope, architecture, repository evidence, alignment gaps, decision-support views, and proposed portfolio changes lack one governed human review surface. Without a canonical-aware console, evidence can remain fragmented and proposed changes can be confused with committed truth.
- Desired outcome: Create a Project Owner administration console that provides evidence-backed portfolio, architecture, repository, guardrail, and decision-support views; a persistent contextual PO Agent workspace; clearly separated Working and Canonical portfolio states; scenario planning; a proposed-change ledger and consolidated Change Set review; and controlled, auditable Markdown write-back through normal repo governance.
- In scope:
  - Project overview; Scope Portfolio; Scope.MD alignment and reconciliation queue; filtering/search; evidence-backed visualizations; Risk-Adjusted Value Matrix; WSJF view; dependency map; MVL / Closed-Loop completeness; Blast Radius view; and Evaluation / Guardrail readiness.
  - Architecture Explorer; Repository Explorer; Markdown inventory; and Guardrail Status, with current application state distinguished from future Closed-Loop architecture.
  - A persistent, context-aware conversational PO Agent workspace alongside Scope, visualizations, and Architecture. Context includes selected scope items, active filters, chart/graph selections, dependency nodes/subgraphs, reconciliation queues, Canonical/Working values, and relevant evidence.
  - Contextual PO interaction that can explain, challenge, compare, recommend, and propose changes across multiple selected scope items without leaving the review surface.
  - Working versus Canonical portfolio state, scenario planning, deterministic recalculation only when required inputs exist, clear Proposed/Uncommitted labeling, individual mutation undo/revert, and a session proposed-change ledger.
  - Consolidated Change Set review showing before/after Markdown, affected scope IDs/files, downstream metric/visual effects, conflicts, and guardrail confirmations before explicit PO approval.
  - Future UI proposals/edits for Priority, Status, description/problem/desired outcome, size/effort, scoring metadata, Next Action, approved ownership/categorization fields, and dependencies.
  - Controlled Markdown write-back that resolves canonical records by stable scope ID, validates branch/current content, fails closed on ambiguous or stale targets, and follows the `GOV-PO-AGENT-001` structured mutation and Change Set persistence contract.
- Out of scope: Application implementation in this capture; duplicate or contradictory console-owned scoring/mutation logic; direct `main` writes; silent Canonical mutation; Supabase/training-data writes; changes to `imports/v8.4/data/*.json`; deployment, merge, or Closed-Loop implementation authorization.
- Acceptance criteria: Approved console capabilities and conversational workflow are design-ready; the console consumes `GOV-PO-AGENT-001` evidence, scoring, recommendation, conversation, dependency, mutation, and approval contracts; Working and Canonical states remain visibly isolated; missing scores are not guessed; one reviewed Change Set drives branch/PR write-back; ambiguous/stale writes fail closed; Scope.MD Aligned = yes.
- Dependencies: Requires `GOV-PO-AGENT-001` as the intelligence/governance foundation. Also depends on canonical `docs/SCOPE.md`, repository/architecture evidence sources, admin authorization, and normal architecture/guardrail and branch/PR governance.
- Risks: A UI-local scoring or mutation model could contradict canonical governance; proposed state could appear committed; visualizations could imply unsupported precision; stale Markdown targets could corrupt scope; admin credentials or write authority could exceed least privilege.
- Next action: Define the console technical design and phased read-only/controlled-write delivery against `GOV-PO-AGENT-001`; do not begin implementation until required design and governance gates are satisfied.
- Links / evidence: GitHub Issue #7; GitHub Issue #7 approved conversational-PO-workspace and `GOV-PO-AGENT-001` dependency comments; GitHub Issue #8; `GOV-PO-AGENT-001`; `AGENTS.md`; `docs/SCOPE.md`.

### GOV-ADMIN-AUTH-HARDENING-001

- ID: GOV-ADMIN-AUTH-HARDENING-001
- Title: Admin authentication & broader-go-live security gate
- Type: Feature / Governance hardening
- Parent: GOV-PO-AGENT-001 / ADMIN-PROJECT-OWNER-CONSOLE-001
- Priority: P3
- Status: Deferred
- Lane: Safe lane / security hardening
- Owner: Product Owner / ChatGPT orchestration / Codex implementation
- Source: Product Owner approval 2026-08-23; GitHub Issue #10.
- Problem: The current private-family deployment intentionally does not require a formal Admin authentication model. An unlinked Admin route is acceptable for this deployment but must not become the security model for broader use.
- Desired outcome: Keep authentication work out of the current critical path while creating an explicit mandatory security gate before broader exposure.
- In scope:
  - Current private-use posture: permit an unlinked/non-navigation Admin route; require no Supabase Auth implementation now; do not broaden athlete anon RLS; keep GitHub secrets server-side; and keep GitHub writes structured, explicitly approved, and branch/PR based.
  - Automatic trigger contract: before any public launch; multi-family/multi-tenant use; external pilot or beta; coach/team/community access outside the current family; broader distribution where untrusted users could discover the Admin route; or materially broader privileged Admin capability, reclassify this item to P0 / Critical and make it a release blocker.
  - When triggered, broader go-live cannot proceed until this security scope is completed or superseded by an explicitly approved stronger design.
  - Future trigger scope: authenticated Admin identity; server-side authorization; authorization negative tests; secrets isolation; least-privilege privileged credentials; appropriate RLS/security review; auditability; and release proof of the hardened boundary.
- Out of scope: Implementing authentication solely for current private-family use; broadening current athlete anon RLS; changing athlete-facing workflows; treating an unlinked route as a permanent security mechanism; application implementation during this docs reconciliation.
- Acceptance criteria: While private-family use continues, the unlinked route is explicitly recognized as convenience rather than authentication and privileged safeguards remain intact. At the first trigger, this item is P0 / Critical and blocks release until authenticated/authorized Admin access, negative-path tests, secret isolation, least privilege, auditability, appropriate security/RLS review, and hardened-boundary release proof are complete or an explicitly approved stronger design supersedes it.
- Dependencies: `GOV-PO-AGENT-001`; `ADMIN-PROJECT-OWNER-CONSOLE-001`; an approved broader-go-live or expanded privileged-capability decision.
- Risks: An unlinked route may be discovered after audience expansion; privileged APIs could be abused without server-side authorization; the item could remain incorrectly low priority unless the automatic trigger is enforced.
- Next action: Remain Deferred/P3 while application remains private-family use. At the first broader-go-live decision, reclassify to P0/Critical before any external exposure.

- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Mike-provided Bell Sensplex 4v4 summer hockey schedule.
- Problem: Confirmed July-August 2026 Bell Sensplex 4v4 games were not represented as planned Sport Load in the current offseason plan surfaces.
- Desired outcome: 4v4 appears as planned Sport Load and part of Maddox's offseason development environment across the approved app surfaces.
- In scope: source capture, schedule verification against user-provided times/arenas, and safe-lane app import into planned Sport Load, Day Execution Plan, Calendar, Day/Today, and Plan/Gantt.
- Out of scope: app implementation in this docs-only task, `imports/v8.4/data/*.json` edits, Supabase writes, completed logs, workout rewrites, KPI work, AI Coach, automatic load-risk labeling, or automatic dryland cancellation.
- Acceptance criteria: the exact schedule is preserved; 4v4 is framed as planned hockey development and Sport Load; integration rules avoid automatic cancellation and use readiness-based adjustment only; source import, Day/Today, Calendar, and Plan/Gantt render the planned Sport Loads.
- Dependencies: source-review approval for the import path; current Sport Load display/logging rules; v8.4 source-update or overlay-import strategy if approved later.
- Risks: treating 4v4 as an overload emergency would misframe the product decision; treating it as non-plan work would hide a high-value hockey stimulus from Day/Calendar/Gantt planning.
- Next action: post-commit/deploy smoke for Plan/Gantt, then return to `AUDIT-LOAD-CLASSIFICATION-001`.
- Links / evidence: Mike source-capture request on 2026-07-05; commits `0bba866`, `d922217`; local `PLAN-GANTT-SPORTLOAD-V84-001` fix.

Product interpretation:

- 4v4 is planned Sport Load and part of Maddox's offseason development environment.
- It supports game-speed decisions, puck touches under pressure, compete, scanning, shift-like conditioning, and confidence attacking space.
- Mike is not concerned that Maddox is overtired; Maddox is faring well.
- Do not label these dates as automatic load-risk days.
- Do not auto-cancel training because of 4v4.
- Adjust surrounding work only based on readiness, soreness, camp stacking, travel, or parent observation.

- Title: Render Plan/Gantt Sport Load overlays from v8.4 Sport Loads
- Type: Defect / Feature
- Parent: `SPORT-LOAD-4V4-SUMMER-2026`
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Production/source-impact QA after `0bba866` and `d922217`.
- Problem: Plan/Gantt still used stale hardcoded/legacy Sport Load interpretation while Day/Today and Calendar rendered v8.4 planned Sport Loads correctly.
- Desired outcome: Plan/Gantt Sport Load overlays and week summaries derive from v8.4 `sportLoads` so July-August 4v4 and existing Sport Loads are visible without duplicating the schedule.
- In scope: bounded Plan page helper and rendering update, focused tests, docs handoff/report update.
- Out of scope: source JSON edits, v8.4 count changes, Supabase, completed logs, Day/Calendar/KPI/Weakness Overlay changes, Gantt visual redesign.
- Acceptance criteria: Plan/Gantt includes Bell Sensplex 4v4 dates and existing Sport Loads; derives from v8.4 data; user-facing copy avoids `External Load`; no forbidden wording.
- Dependencies: v8.4 `sportLoads.json`; existing locked Gantt weeks/phase model.
- Risks: stale hardcoded Plan rows can hide newly imported Sport Loads or mislead planning.
- Next action: post-deploy smoke, then return to `AUDIT-LOAD-CLASSIFICATION-001`.
- Links / evidence: local helper `lib/planSportLoadOverlay.ts`; tests `lib/planSportLoadOverlay.test.ts`.

### DEF-GANTT-SPORTLOAD-DURATION-001

- ID: DEF-GANTT-SPORTLOAD-DURATION-001
- Title: Plan/Gantt displays day-specific Sport Loads without true daily Gantt semantics
- Type: Defect
- Parent: Plan/Gantt / Sport Load presentation
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Mike product QA after `f247959`.
- Problem: Daily Sport Loads such as 4v4 Hockey, lacrosse, and Marc O'Connor ice should not render as full-week duration bars or as text labels crammed into weekly cells. The prior `ec283ce` fix correctly derived date semantics but failed the visual model: Mike rejected it because it still looked like a weekly chip table, not a real Gantt.
- Desired outcome: Plan/Gantt renders a true daily-scale Gantt for the 14-week performance period while preserving v8.4 as the source of truth.
- In scope: bounded Plan/Gantt presentation fix, 84-day timeline helper logic, v8.4-derived Sport Load date/span logic, focused tests, required docs updates, and no data mutation.
- Out of scope: source JSON edits, import count changes, Supabase, completed logs, Calendar/Day/KPI changes, broad Gantt redesign, or new training content.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Time axis has 12 week headers and 84 daily sub-columns.
  - Week 7 is `2026-07-27` through `2026-08-02`; Week 8 is `2026-08-03` through `2026-08-09`.
  - Single-day Sport Loads render as date-specific markers, not rectangular weekly chips or duration bars.
  - Multi-day Sport Loads render as bars spanning exact dates.
  - 4v4 appears in every scheduled date's correct week/day, including Aug 3 as Week 8 Monday.
  - Lacrosse appears only on actual lacrosse dates.
  - Marc O'Connor appears only on actual Marc O'Connor dates.
  - Toronto Trip spans Jul 31 through Aug 3.
  - Chase Hull Camp spans Jul 6-10; Carleton Ravens Camp spans Aug 4-7; Sensplex Camp spans Aug 24-28.
  - Methodology phases render as bars spanning true week/date ranges.
  - Gantt must visually resemble a real Gantt chart, with readable rows, daily grid, and horizontal scroll if needed.
- Dependencies: `PLAN-GANTT-SPORTLOAD-V84-001`; v8.4 `sportLoads`; existing Plan/Gantt helper.
- Risks: week-wide bars can mislead Mike/Maddox into thinking a single-day Sport Load lasts all week.
- Findings: Plan/Gantt already derived Sport Load rows from v8.4, but marker cells compressed same-week events into week-level labels and one old static Chase Hull Camp row still rendered a full-week camp bar. The first fix at `ec283ce` added visible date labels/ranges but still used weekly cells and was rejected visually.
- Week mapping clarification: app week boundaries are Week 7 `2026-07-27` to `2026-08-02` and Week 8 `2026-08-03` to `2026-08-09`; therefore Aug 3 4v4 and Aug 3 Toronto Trip return day are Week 8.
- Rejected local fix: `ec283ce` rendered date-specific chips/ranges inside week cells; Mike rejected the visual result as not true Gantt semantics.
- Corrective implementation: `lib/planSportLoadOverlay.ts` now exposes daily timeline helpers, date-to-week/day mapping, grid-column span helpers, and marker/bar display classification. `app/plan/page.tsx` renders an 84-day daily grid with week headers spanning 7 day columns, phase bars across real dates, diamond markers for single-day Sport Loads, star markers for test milestones, and bars for multi-day Sport Loads.
- Visual-review correction: Mike's local review of the first daily-scale pass found excessive vertical whitespace and clipped full date labels in daily header cells. The current local correction uses compact row spacing, 28px Gantt rows, centered 16px bars, centered 20px markers, and day-of-month header numbers below weekday letters.
- Second visual-review correction: remaining row whitespace came from `h-7`/`min-h-7`/empty-cell `h-7` in the Gantt body. Current body rows now use a shared 22px height, 12px bars, and 16px markers.
- Third visual-review correction: weekly separators looked broken because daily and weekly vertical lines were row-local borders on empty day cells. Current body grid uses a continuous chart-level daily background and full-height weekly separator rules through all activity rows.
- Fourth visual-review correction: weekly separators did not line up with headers because the header used CSS grid/gap/flexible columns while the body overlay used independent percentage math. Current header, body rows, background grid, weekly rules, bars, and markers share one fixed timeline geometry: `12rem` label column plus 84 `1.1rem` day columns.
- Refinement pass: the Gantt is now visually organized into two compact sections: `Sport Loads / Events / Testing` above `Methodology Phases`. Dated items and one-off markers stay in the upper section; methodology phase bars run from GPP/Foundation through Taper + Peak in the lower section.
- Sticky-label correction: normal activity labels were clipped during horizontal scroll because their row container used `overflow-hidden`; section headers did not have the same clipping. Current label cells use sticky left positioning with opaque backgrounds, a right border, and subtle shadow.
- Tests: `lib/planSportLoadOverlay.test.ts` covers 84 day columns, Week 7/Week 8 boundaries, Aug 3 as Week 8 Monday, 4v4 date-to-week/day mapping, marker vs bar display kind, Toronto Trip and camp spans, and forbidden wording absence.
- Acceptance and release: Mike visually accepted the daily-scale Gantt locally; commit `8c51cc8` (`fix(plan): render daily gantt with sticky labels`) was pushed to `main` and production-smoked after deployment.
- Production evidence: production output/chunks contained `8c51cc8`; `/plan` returned 200; accepted indicators `Phase Gantt`, `Sport Loads / Events / Testing`, `Methodology Phases`, exact-day milestones, and exact-date bars were present; production Supabase ref `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko` was present; staging ref `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz` was absent.
- Next action: verify a fresh Preview runtime uses staging before Preview write testing.
- Links / evidence: Mike acceptance and production smoke after `8c51cc8`; implementation files `app/plan/page.tsx`, `lib/planSportLoadOverlay.ts`, `lib/planSportLoadOverlay.test.ts`.

### DEF-REACT-DUPLICATE-KEY-EASY-SPIN-001

- ID: DEF-REACT-DUPLICATE-KEY-EASY-SPIN-001
- Title: React duplicate key warning for repeated Easy Spin instruction text
- Type: Defect
- Parent: UI rendering correctness / React list keys
- Priority: P2
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Terminal 1 dev-server React/browser warning after `ec283ce`.
- Problem: React reported duplicate child keys for repeated instruction text. Warning text observed: `Encountered two children with the same key, \`Easy spin 2 minutes.\`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted.`
- Root cause: `KPIProtocolDetails` and `SessionKPIForm` rendered `kpi.instructions` with `key={instruction}`. KPI `kpi-zwift-bike-3x10s-peak-power` contains the valid instruction `Easy spin 2 minutes.` twice, so both siblings received the same key.
- Desired outcome: repeated instruction text can render safely without React duplicate-key warnings or identity instability.
- In scope: inspect the relevant rendering path and replace display-text-only keys with stable contextual keys such as parent ID, section ID, item index, or source item identity as appropriate.
- Out of scope: deleting or deduplicating repeated workout instruction content, editing source JSON, changing training content, Supabase, Vercel, or broad UI redesign.
- Acceptance criteria: repeated `Easy spin 2 minutes.` instructions can render without duplicate-key warnings; duplicate wording remains intact if the content is valid.
- Dependencies: Gantt push/deploy/smoke should complete first so this does not mix into the Gantt implementation commit.
- Risks: data risk is low; UI correctness risk is medium because non-unique keys can cause React to duplicate or omit children during updates.
- Fix and release: both KPI instruction renderers use `${kpi.id}-instruction-${index}`, providing stable parent/section context plus source order without changing visible content; pushed at `7a70272`.
- Regression: `components/KPIProtocolDetails.test.tsx` asserts both repeated instructions remain in rendered output and React emits no duplicate-key error; `TCG-006` records the reusable KPI rendering coverage.
- Production smoke: public output/chunks contained `7a70272`; `/kpis` returned 200; isolated headless Chrome found zero duplicate-key matches, zero console warnings/errors, and zero page errors; neither duplicate-key warning appeared; `Easy spin 2 minutes.` remained rendered exactly twice. Production ref was present and staging ref absent.
- Next action: verify a fresh Preview runtime uses staging before Preview write testing.
- Links / evidence: Terminal 1 warning observed by Mike; commit `7a70272`; `components/KPIProtocolDetails.tsx`; `components/SessionKPIForm.tsx`; `components/KPIProtocolDetails.test.tsx`; read-only production smoke on 2026-07-10.

### DEF-ENV-PREVIEW-SUPABASE-MAPPING-001

- ID: DEF-ENV-PREVIEW-SUPABASE-MAPPING-001
- Title: Preview/Staging/Production Supabase mapping is not sufficiently visible
- Type: Defect
- Parent: Environment safety
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Docs-only / environment-safety
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Mike environment-safety concern after preview/staging observations.
- Problem: Vercel Preview and Vercel Development previously inherited production Supabase variables through Vercel's "All Environments" scope. Mike has now split the variables by environment, but old Preview deployments remain production-risk until replaced or verified.
- Desired outcome: Environment mapping is documented clearly enough that Mike can tell whether local, Preview, and Production operations are safe before any write-capable test.
- In scope: inspect/document mapping for local development, Vercel Preview, Vercel Production, Supabase staging, and Supabase production; document staging auto-pause behavior; confirm no writes or env changes during audit.
- Out of scope: changing environment variables, rotating keys, mutating Supabase, adding keepalive automation, or deploying.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Identify which Supabase project local development uses.
  - Identify which Supabase project Vercel Preview uses.
  - Identify which Supabase project Vercel Production uses.
  - Document staging auto-pause risk.
  - Document what happens if staging is paused.
  - Confirm no environment variables are changed during the audit.
  - Confirm no Supabase writes are performed.
- Dependencies: `scripts/preflight.mjs`, `scripts/env-whoami.mjs`, Vercel/Supabase environment access where available.
- Risks: old Preview deployments may still use production Supabase until redeployed; Preview write testing before runtime verification could still mutate production data.
- Next action: Completed; maintain staging target checks before any write-capable Preview QA.
- Links / evidence: prior `ENV-PREVIEW-DB-001`, `ENV-PREVIEW-DB-AUDIT-001`; fresh Preview `0794f70` proved staging ref `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`.

Audit findings on 2026-07-08:

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local development | `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz` | Known | `.env.local` `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` project ref; `node scripts/env-whoami.mjs` classified local as staging | This matches the known staging project. No keys were printed. |
| Supabase staging | `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz` | Known | Mike-provided staging warning; `docs/KPI_CLOUD_SYNC_STAGING_TEST_PLAN.md`; `.env.local` | Project name: `maddox-training-os-staging`. Region previously documented as West US (Oregon) `us-west-2`. |
| Supabase production | `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko` | Known from local backup/docs | `.env.local.production-backup` URL project ref; `docs/STARTUP.md` production Supabase dashboard link | Treat as production Maddox data. Do not print keys or use for local writes without explicit production confirmation. |
| Vercel Production | `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko` | Confirmed final config by Mike from Vercel Project Settings | Production has exactly two Supabase rows, production-scoped, and no All Environments Supabase rows | Correct target for production. Do not redeploy Production as part of this docs task. |
| Vercel Preview | `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz` | Confirmed final config by Mike from Vercel Project Settings | Preview has exactly two Supabase rows, preview-scoped, and no All Environments Supabase rows | Correct target for future Preview deployments. Existing old Preview deployments remain production-risk until replaced or verified. |
| Vercel Development | `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz` | Confirmed final config by Mike from Vercel Project Settings | Development has exactly two Supabase rows, development-scoped, and no All Environments Supabase rows | Correct target for future Development deployments. |

Confirmed Vercel dashboard update supplied by Mike on 2026-07-09:

- Production `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` points to `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko`.
- Preview `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` points to `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`.
- Development `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` points to `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`.
- Production anon key was restored as Production-scoped.

- Do not copy, paste, screenshot, or commit Supabase anon keys, service-role keys, tokens, JWTs, passwords, or full secret values.
- Environment-variable changes affect new deployments.
- Existing old Preview deployments should still be treated as production-risk until replaced or verified.
- Do not redeploy Production as part of this docs task.

Production runtime smoke on 2026-07-09:

- Production runtime verification passed.
- The served Production deployment output contained commit/hash `87355a4`, which was pushed after the Vercel environment split.
- Production routes returned 200: `/`, `/today`, `/plan`, `/calendar`, `/dashboard`, `/kpis`, `/history`.
- Production output/bundles referenced production Supabase ref `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko`.
- Production output/bundles did not reference staging Supabase ref `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`.
- `/api/kpi-export` returned 200 JSON.
- KPI export mode: `cloud`.
- KPI export count: `21`.
- Expected Maddox KPI indicators were visible/readable.
- No writes, config changes, redeploys, commits, pushes, Supabase changes, file edits, or secrets occurred during the smoke.
- Preview/Development runtime verification remains pending.
- Old Preview deployments remain production-risk until replaced or verified.
- A fresh Preview deployment must be verified as staging before Preview write testing.

### DEF-ENV-PREVIEW-STAGING-OVERRIDE-001

- ID: DEF-ENV-PREVIEW-STAGING-OVERRIDE-001
- Title: Configure Vercel Preview and Development Supabase variables to use staging
- Type: Defect / Task
- Parent: `DEF-ENV-PREVIEW-SUPABASE-MAPPING-001`
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Environment safety / config change
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Mike manual Vercel dashboard confirmation on 2026-07-08.
- Problem: Vercel Supabase variables were scoped to "All Environments," so Preview and Development inherited production Supabase ref `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko`.
- Desired outcome: Replace All-Environments inheritance for Preview/Development with environment-specific staging Supabase URL and anon key, while leaving Production pointed at production Supabase.
- Final configured behavior:
  - Production -> `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko`
  - Preview -> `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`
  - Development -> `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`
- In scope: document Mike's completed Vercel environment split; record runtime verification requirement for fresh Preview deployments.
- Out of scope: Supabase mutation, key rotation unless explicitly approved, app code changes, source JSON edits, tests/builds in this docs capture.
- Acceptance criteria: Production remains mapped to production; Preview and Development map to staging; no Supabase variables remain scoped to All Environments; no secret values are exposed in terminal, docs, screenshots, or commits; no Supabase writes occur during the config change.
- Dependencies: staging project `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`; production project `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko`; Vercel project settings access.
- Risks: existing old Preview deployments may still point to production until replaced; Preview runtime verification is still required before Preview write testing.
- Next action: Completed; no further environment override work is required unless Vercel variables change.
- Links / evidence: Mike manual Vercel Project Settings confirmation on 2026-07-09; fresh Preview runtime/build proof `0794f70` on 2026-08-21; `DEF-ENV-PREVIEW-SUPABASE-MAPPING-001`.

### DEF-SUPABASE-STAGING-AUTOPAUSE-001

- ID: DEF-SUPABASE-STAGING-AUTOPAUSE-001
- Title: Supabase staging project at risk of inactivity auto-pause
- Type: Defect
- Parent: Environment safety
- Priority: P2
- Status: In progress
- Lane: Docs-only / environment-safety
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Supabase inactivity warning reported by Mike.
- Problem: Supabase sent an inactivity warning for `maddox-training-os-staging`, project ID `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`. The project is not paused yet, but may be paused automatically if it continues not to receive sufficient activity.
- Desired outcome: Decide how staging uptime should be handled without confusing staging failures with production app defects.
- In scope: document the warning, staging/local QA impact, and decision options.
- Out of scope: keepalive implementation, paid-plan upgrade, Supabase writes, or environment changes in this docs capture.
- Acceptance criteria: Production is not identified in the warning; staging/local QA failure mode is documented; decision options are captured.
- Dependencies: `DEF-ENV-PREVIEW-SUPABASE-MAPPING-001`.
- Risks: paused staging can break local/preview QA and drive accidental production testing.
- Next action: decide whether to allow staging to pause and manually resume, create a safe read-only staging health check, or upgrade Supabase if staging uptime becomes important.
- Links / evidence: Supabase warning for `maddox-training-os-staging`, project ID `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`.

Audit findings on 2026-07-08:

- Supabase staging project name: `maddox-training-os-staging`.
- Supabase staging project ID/ref: `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`.
- Current warning state from Mike: project is not paused yet, but may auto-pause if inactive.
- Local development currently points to this staging project.
- If staging pauses, local development and any correctly configured Vercel Preview environment may fail to load or sync cloud data until staging is resumed.
- This warning does not identify production.
- No keepalive, billing, project-resume, environment-variable, or database changes were made during this audit.

Decision options:

- Allow staging to auto-pause and manually resume it from Supabase dashboard when needed.
- Add a safe read-only staging health check only if keeping staging warm becomes important.
- Upgrade Supabase only if staging uptime becomes important enough to justify it.

### QA-AUTOMATION-OWNERSHIP-001

- ID: QA-AUTOMATION-OWNERSHIP-001
- Title: Shift recurring smoke/regression testing from Codex to deterministic scripts and CI
- Type: Epic
- Parent: QA system
- Priority: P1
- Status: In progress
- Lane: Docs-only / QA ownership
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Mike workflow concern after repeated production smoke tasks.
- Problem: Codex is being used too often as a recurring manual test runner. This burns context, 5-hour limit, weekly limit, and Mike approval time.
- Desired outcome: Recurring QA moves into deterministic scripts and CI, with Codex used to write tests and analyze failures rather than repeatedly click or fetch the same pages.
- In scope: ownership model, QA automation sequencing, smoke-suite scope, and usage-reduction guardrails.
- Out of scope: implementing Playwright tests in this docs capture, installing packages, GitHub Actions, or production smoke execution.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Codex writes tests.
  - npm scripts / Terminal / CI run repeatable tests.
  - Codex analyzes failures.
  - Mike performs product acceptance only.
- Dependencies: `QA-PLAYWRIGHT-SMOKE-001`, existing QA contract docs.
- Risks: continued manual smoke work burns Codex usage and increases approval friction.
- Next action: Finish explicit Today and Plan/Gantt browser smoke/release-gate coverage; forward Day/Log, Calendar, video, KPI, build, Vitest, and TypeScript checks are already GitHub-owned.
- Links / evidence: PR #4; `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; green GitHub Actions run on head `3cbc84e`; Production merge `38a2751`.

- Priority: P1
- Status: In progress
- Lane: Safe lane / QA automation
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Mike workflow concern and repeated read-only production smoke checks.
- Problem: Core-route smoke validation is being performed manually/ad hoc by Codex instead of repeatable automation.
- Desired outcome: Read-only deterministic smoke tests cover Today, Day, Calendar, Plan/Gantt, and KPI visibility so recurring route checks do not require bespoke Codex sessions.
- In scope: reusable Playwright smoke suite design and implementation in a later task using existing approved tooling.
- Out of scope: Playwright install in this docs capture, production writes, save/submit flows, broad QA matrix expansion, or app behavior changes.
- Acceptance criteria: repeatable smoke command validates core route rendering and key labels without mutating data.
- Dependencies: `QA-AUTOMATION-OWNERSHIP-001`, QA contract docs, existing Playwright proof-of-life.
- Risks: without deterministic smoke coverage, product acceptance continues to rely on screenshots and one-off Codex runs.
- Next action: Add explicit read-only Today and Plan/Gantt browser assertions, then consider this core-route smoke task complete.

- Priority: P1
- Status: In progress
- Lane: Docs-only / QA workflow
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Mike workflow concern.
- Problem: Codex sessions are repeatedly used for manual browser/fetch smoke checks that should be deterministic scripts.
- Desired outcome: Recurring smoke checks become scripted/CI-owned, with Codex reserved for test creation, interpretation, and fixes.
- In scope: workflow defect capture and linkage to `QA-PLAYWRIGHT-SMOKE-001`.
- Out of scope: implementing tests in this docs capture.
- Acceptance criteria: recurring smoke scope has a deterministic owner and no longer defaults to ad hoc Codex sessions.
- Dependencies: `QA-AUTOMATION-OWNERSHIP-001`.
- Risks: Codex usage limits and Mike approval burden continue to be consumed by repeat validation.
- Next action: Eliminate the remaining recurring manual Today/Plan-Gantt smoke once those routes are CI-covered.
- Links / evidence: repeated production smoke requests; PR #4 GitHub-owned browser regression.

- Parent: `QA-AUTOMATION-OWNERSHIP-001`
- Priority: P2

- Lane: Docs-only / workflow
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Mike usage concern.
- Problem: There is no lightweight ledger that helps track when Codex usage is spent on implementation, QA automation creation, repeated smoke execution, or planning.
- Desired outcome: A prompt-level usage ledger or equivalent workflow record helps avoid spending Codex time on repeatable test-running work.
- In scope: define a small usage-ledger approach after higher-priority environment and Gantt items.
- Out of scope: building dashboards, automating billing/usage introspection, or changing Codex product settings.
- Acceptance criteria: future sessions can classify usage by task type and identify repeat work that should move to scripts/CI.
- Dependencies: `QA-AUTOMATION-OWNERSHIP-001`.
- Risks: usage concerns remain anecdotal and hard to improve.
- Next action: create ledger scope/design after `QA-PLAYWRIGHT-SMOKE-001` is underway.
- Links / evidence: Mike concern that Codex is burning context, the 5-hour limit, weekly limit, and approval time.

- Type: Source Review
- Parent: Training/source system
- Priority: P1
- Status: Scope review required
- Lane: Source-review
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Gemini intake
- Problem: strength and conditioning content must remain age-appropriate for a U12 athlete.
- Desired outcome: safety guardrails inform future source review and app language.
- In scope: safety review, pain/fatigue/sloppy-mechanics stop rules, adult-pressure avoidance.
- Out of scope: immediate app changes unless separately tasked.
- Acceptance criteria: future source updates respect U12 safety constraints.
- Dependencies: source-review phase.
- Risks: overloading or unsafe guidance.

- Type: Source Review
- Parent: Training/source system
- Priority: P1
- Status: Scope review required
- Lane: Source-review
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Gemini intake
- Problem: hard hockey conditioning and easy recovery cardio serve different purposes.
- Desired outcome: source model and app language distinguish intervals from recovery work.
- In scope: source-review model and future app copy/rules.
- Out of scope: adding conditioning load silently.
- Acceptance criteria: recovery bike/walk is not treated as hard conditioning.
- Dependencies: recovery day model.
- Risks: accidental overtraining or misleading load.
- Next action: clarify during recovery/source-review work.

### CONDITIONING-CARDIO-DURATION-001

- ID: CONDITIONING-CARDIO-DURATION-001
- Title: Permanent load-based controlled bike/treadmill duration rule
- Type: Task
- Parent: Training/source system
- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Fast lane / canonical plan-source or projection-rule implementation
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Mike scope registration request; related DEF-020 and CONDITIONING-MODEL-001.
- Problem: Controlled bike/treadmill cardio duration must manage total training load instead of using a single duration across easy, medium, and hard days.
- Desired outcome: Controlled bike/treadmill cardio uses a permanent day-load rule: easy days 45 minutes, medium days 30 minutes, hard days 20 minutes.
- In scope: identify the canonical source/rule layer for planned controlled bike/treadmill duration, determine day load reliably, recognize controlled bike/treadmill entries, implement the smallest permanent rule, and prove Day plus active Session parity and all-84 Day readiness.
- Out of scope: DEF-029 copy clarity unless the exact same canonical source row must be touched and the copy change is narrow and obvious; saved records; Supabase; logging behavior; KPI logic; Dashboard; History; Calendar; Exports; Gantt; broad training-plan rewrites; hardcoded date exceptions.
- Acceptance criteria: controlled bike/treadmill cardio easy days = 45 minutes; controlled bike/treadmill cardio medium days = 30 minutes; controlled bike/treadmill cardio hard days = 20 minutes; implemented in canonical source/rule layer, not a page-specific override; Day and active Session duration parity remains verified; all-84 Day readiness proof remains passing; no saved data or Supabase mutation.
- Dependencies: DEF-020; CONDITIONING-MODEL-001; completed ACTIVITY-PRESENTATION-CONTRACT-001 and DAY-SESSION-PARITY-001 guardrails.
- Risks: corrupting approved plan data, masking source issues with UI-only overrides, mutating saved evidence, or accidentally changing non-bike/treadmill conditioning prescriptions.
- Next action: keep the completed duration rule unchanged; use `AUDIT-LOAD-CLASSIFICATION-001` to explain current duration/load-tier rendering and feed `DEF-032`.
- Links / evidence: Completed by `a01beca`; shared planned-activity projection applies controlled cardio durations of 45 minutes for easy/recovery/lighter/deload days, 30 minutes for medium days, and 20 minutes for hard days; Day and active Session consume the same projected planned duration; proof passed with `npx vitest run lib/projections/activityPresentation.test.ts lib/projections/dayPresentation.test.ts` (20/20), `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `node scripts/verify-v8.4-import.mjs`, and `git diff --check`. Related: DEF-020; DEF-029 was reopened by later product QA; DEF-032 now owns explainability concerns; CONDITIONING-MODEL-001; commits `c20432c`, `05019f5`, `6ab3f5e`, and `f5c35a8`.

Hard rejection criteria:

- Saved session rewrite.
- Supabase mutation.
- User-entered data mutation.
- Logging behavior change.
- Hardcoded date table.
- UI-only override if a canonical source/rule exists.

- Problem: Tactical controlled-cardio defects exposed multiple rendering paths, inconsistent classification, source/raw wording leaks, ad hoc load classification risk, and no accepted methodology-grade day/activity/domain load model.
- Desired outcome: Closed-Loop methodology moves through Conceptual Design -> Functional Design -> Technical Design -> Research / Validation Design -> Current-App Transition Plan -> Data-Retention / No-Data-Loss Plan -> QA / Safety Design -> Build Readiness -> Implementation.
- In scope: design gates, role/RACI, required design packages, current-app protection, no-data-loss requirements, and build-readiness criteria.
- Out of scope: implementation, current-app retrofit, final domain count selection, final data source selection, Supabase mutation, source JSON edits, app code edits.
- Acceptance criteria: no Closed-Loop implementation begins until conceptual, functional, technical, research/validation, transition, data-retention, integration/retrofit, QA/test, and build-readiness gates are accepted.
- Dependencies: TRANSITION-001, DATA-GOV-001, SOURCE-VALIDATION-001, DOMAIN-DECISION-001.

- Source: Architecture checkpoint
- Problem: Future methodology architecture could destabilize current production app or silently change saved training history if retrofitted too early.
- Desired outcome: current app remains production system; v8.4 remains authoritative; future methodology layer is designed in parallel before integration.
- In scope: current-app protection, compatibility requirements, rollback/no-data-loss strategy, source JSON protection, Supabase/schema protection, saved-data immutability.
- Out of scope: migrations, schema changes, Supabase writes, source edits, behavior changes.
- Acceptance criteria: implementation cannot start without approved transition, integration/retrofit, rollback, and no-data-loss plan.
- Dependencies: DATA-GOV-001, TD-006, TD-012.
- Risks: tactical defects could become stealth methodology implementation.

- Lane: Docs-only / data-governance
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Architecture checkpoint
- Problem: Future domain scoring, personalization, recommendations, and plan adjustments require versioning, provenance, auditability, and no-data-loss rules before persistence work.
- Desired outcome: version every exercise-domain profile, methodology model, and scoring rule set; preserve provenance, confidence, validation status, recommendation audit trail, and parent approval/rejection/defer decisions.
- In scope: data-retention design, immutable production history rule, reversible/replayable migration requirement, child-athlete privacy/safety considerations.
- Out of scope: current Supabase mutation, schema changes, data migration.
- Acceptance criteria: future methodology data cannot overwrite production history, silently rewrite plans, or mutate global baseline matrix scores from athlete-specific output.
- Dependencies: MODEL-GOVERNANCE-001, ATHLETE-PERSONALIZATION-001.
- Risks: model/scoring changes could become untraceable.

- Type: Source Review
- Parent: DESIGN-GATE-001
- Priority: P1
- Status: In progress
- Lane: Docs-only / research-capture
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Architecture checkpoint
- Problem: The app lacks an accepted way to source and validate exercise-domain scores without in-house sports science staff.
- Desired outcome: candidate source classes are evaluated without treating any one source as authoritative.
- In scope: commercial metadata APIs, open-source biomechanics datasets, literature review, manual expert review, deterministic heuristic scoring, LLM-assisted attribute extraction.
- Out of scope: selecting final source, final score model, final domain count, commercial API, or production scoring dataset.
- Acceptance criteria: LLMs may extract structured biomechanical attributes but may not directly assign final 0-10 exercise-domain scores without deterministic rules and validation.
- Dependencies: RESEARCH-REPOSITORIES-001, KNOWLEDGE-INGESTION-001, HEURISTIC-SCORING-001.

- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed
- Lane: Docs-only / inspect-only
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Product QA after `f5c35a8`
- Problem: Current production QA indicates copy, category, and duration rendering may vary by Day presentation path.
- Desired outcome: determine how every day and controlled bike/treadmill activity is currently classified; explain 20/30/45/10-15/other durations; identify old-copy leaks and raw KPI category leaks; identify whether behavior is source-data-driven, projection-driven, or page-render-path-driven.
- In scope: discovery only across all v8.4 days and relevant rendering paths.
- Out of scope: behavior fixes, all-day methodology implementation, source JSON edits, tests, Playwright, Supabase.
- Acceptance criteria: audit feeds DEF-029/030/031/032 and future design program without implementing the methodology architecture.
- Dependencies: current app source inspection only.
- Risks: another narrow fix could miss a rendering path without this audit.
- Next action: Audit is closed; preserve the easy 45 / medium 30 / hard 20 regression matrix and corrected category/copy behavior.

- Type: Defect
- Parent: PLAN-CONTENT-001 / QA-PLAYWRIGHT-SMOKE-001
- Priority: P1
- Status: CI verified / Production pending
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Product-truth discovery while adding explicit Plan browser smoke on 2026-08-21.
- Problem: v8.4 defines W1-W14 and 96 plan dates through 2026-09-18, while the Plan page still labeled itself 12 weeks, used an 84-day Gantt grid, scoped Taper + Peak to W12 only, and sourced overview/week-card coverage from legacy data ending 2026-09-06.
- Desired outcome: /plan visibly represents the authoritative 14-week / 96-day performance period through Sep 18 without rewriting v8.4 or inventing W13/W14 legacy metrics.
- In scope: derive Plan heading/date range and Gantt geometry from v8.4 phase dates; span Taper + Peak through W14; surface source-backed W13/W14 phase notes and Sport Loads; explicitly label the legacy Weekly Load chart W1-W12; add Today + Plan Playwright smoke.
- Out of scope: edits to imports/v8.4/data/*.json, invented W13/W14 planned-load scores or coaching copy, Day/Calendar/KPI behavior, Supabase writes/config.
- Acceptance criteria: /plan represents the authoritative 14-week / 96-day performance period through 2026-09-18; Taper + Peak spans through W14; source-backed W13/W14 phase notes and Sport Loads are visible; the legacy Weekly Load chart is explicitly labeled W1-W12; Today + Plan browser smoke passes; no v8.4 source data or unsupported W13/W14 values are invented.
- Acceptance evidence: PR #6 final head f86611f; exact net product diff app/plan/page.tsx, components/WeeklyLoadChart.tsx, e2e/forward-product-quality.spec.ts; unit/projection tests passed; TypeScript passed; clean production build passed; full forward Playwright passed; exact-head Vercel Preview READY.
- Remaining gate: merge PR #6 and verify resulting Production deployment before marking Completed.
- Dependencies: v8.4 phaseLabels, ganttModel, Sport Loads; existing legacy W1-W12 descriptive plan copy.
- Risks: duplicating or inventing late-period plan values would violate v8.4 source authority.
- Next action: merge after this scope update, then Production-smoke /plan and verify release SHA.

- Problem: v8.4 `sessions.estimatedDurationMin`, raw `dayExecutionPlan` duration sums, projected executable activity durations, Sport Load durations, and whole-day duration do not share a proven semantic scope and materially disagree on all six representative dates.
- Desired outcome: each duration is explicitly scoped and only like-for-like values are compared; no replacement duration is invented.
- In scope: duration-scope types/diagnostics, source-semantics investigation, representative-date evidence.
- Out of scope: source JSON edits, forced reconciliation, plan redesign, illness/KPI rescheduling, saved-data mutation.
- Acceptance criteria: Training Work, Sport Load, support/readiness/reflection, session estimate, and whole-day duration scopes are defined; diagnostics do not compare unlike totals as equivalent.
- Dependencies: v8.4 source review; canonical Day projection.
- Risks: a misleading single total can undermine athlete trust or silently change training volume.
- Next action: keep open after Phase 1B; determine authoritative duration semantics before choosing any displayed aggregate.

- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed locally
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Phase 1 pre-commit audit of 2026-07-27.
- Problem: canonical KPI state can be false while `buildDayPresentation()` independently infers a KPI day from incidental text such as `None before KPI`.
- Desired outcome: canonical executable KPI state solely controls Day KPI chips, copy, CTAs, and evidence state.
- In scope: explicit canonical KPI input, removal of incidental-text inference from the canonical Day path, rendered regression coverage.
- Out of scope: new KPI checkpoints, missed-KPI rescheduling, source JSON edits, saved KPI data.
- Acceptance criteria: July 27 is not presented as an executable KPI checkpoint; June 30 approved exception remains stable.
- Dependencies: canonical Day projection.
- Risks: false testing instructions can cause inappropriate athlete testing.
- Next action: obtain commit approval; retain the July 27 and June 30 route regressions.

- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Phase 1 pre-commit diff audit.
- Problem: `/training-work/[date]` prefers legacy title, duration, blocks, and workout identity after Day/Today moved to canonical v8.4-first truth.
- Desired outcome: Training Work logging consumes canonical Day identity and relevant source references while remaining independent from Sport Load evidence.
- In scope: route projection/read model and targeted render coverage.
- Out of scope: historical log mutation, Supabase changes, Sport Load/Training Work evidence merging.
- Acceptance criteria: Training Work title/session identity and duration metadata come from canonical Day; saving Training Work does not complete Sport Load.
- Dependencies: canonical Day projection.
- Risks: logging evidence can be attached to a title or duration that contradicts Day.
- Next action: obtain commit approval; retain canonical identity and independent-evidence regression coverage.

- Priority: P1
- Status: Completed locally
- Lane: Source-review / Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Phase 1 pre-commit audit of 2026-08-05.
- Problem: structured source meaning `None - camp provides sport conditioning` is transformed into a required 20-minute `Controlled bike or treadmill` activity because incidental notes contain bike/treadmill wording.
- Desired outcome: explicit non-executable source meaning wins over keyword inference without deleting real prescribed work.
- In scope: executable-state projection, title/instruction preservation, Aug 5 rendered regression coverage.
- Out of scope: source JSON edits, invented replacement conditioning, plan redesign.
- Acceptance criteria: Aug 5 does not prescribe extra cardio; source trace remains available; real Training Work and Sport Load items remain intact.
- Dependencies: canonical activity presentation.
- Risks: invented cardio can stack conditioning on top of camp and 4v4.
- Next action: obtain commit approval; keep explicit non-executable source-semantics coverage.

- Priority: P2
- Status: Completed locally
- Lane: Fast lane
- Owner: Mike / Codex
- Source: Phase 1 pre-commit diff audit.
- Problem: Sport Loads appear as dedicated logging cards and again as execution-sequence prescriptions, making one planned load look like two items.
- Desired outcome: each Sport Load appears once as Day context/prescription while its independent logging action remains accessible; Training Work logging stays separate.
- In scope: Day render composition and rendered Aug 5 regression coverage.
- Out of scope: evidence-stream merging, Sport Load source edits, Plan/Gantt redesign.
- Acceptance criteria: Aug 5 renders each Sport Load prescription once, exposes each Sport Load log action, and separately exposes Training Work logging.
- Dependencies: canonical Day projection.
- Risks: duplicate presentation confuses athlete workload and evidence expectations.

- Priority: P1
- Status: Scope review required
- Lane: Source-review
- Owner: Mike / source owner
- Source: 2026-08-18 forward-cutover verification.
- Problem: v8.4 contained the exact Phase 5 Week 2 A exercise and conditioning dose, but the associated warmup/cooldown was represented only by incomplete `WU-10` and `MOB-15` references.
- Desired outcome: obtain and import the approved warmup/cooldown exercise sequence without changing the 55-minute Speed Stack budget.
- In scope: authoritative source inspection and exact protocol import/reference.
- Out of scope: invented warmup/cooldown exercises, extra duration, generic replacement content, historical changes.
- Acceptance criteria: the Aug 18 logging flow can show exact approved warmup/cooldown exercise detail inside the existing 55-minute Stack activity.
- Dependencies: parent-approved Off-Season Domination 2025 Full Bodyweight Program Speed Stack A warm-up/cooldown page.
- Risks: inventing detail would violate source authority; omitting it leaves the detailed execution flow less complete than requested.
- Findings: the approved source now supplies four exact warm-up groups, 18 warm-up exercises, three cooldown exercises, cooldown breathing instructions, and one source-level demonstration playlist. They are represented once in `speedStackSupportModules.json`; the playlist remains module-level and is not assigned to individual exercises.

## Training / Source Scope

- Current-app P1 focus is the remaining QA smoke/release coverage followed by `DEF-DAY-DURATION-CONTRACT-001`; Closed-Loop methodology remains design-gated.
- Recovery days are not blank days.
- OvertimeAthlete source ingestion/review is future source-review only.
- U12 safety guardrails are source-review scope, not immediate app changes.
- Hockey conditioning intervals must be distinguished from recovery Zone 2 cardio.
- Bell Sensplex 4v4 summer hockey is planned Sport Load and a high-value hockey stimulus; integrate `SPORT-LOAD-4V4-SUMMER-2026` through source-review and safe-lane app import rather than treating it as non-plan work.
- Instruction/video coverage audit is required for athlete-actionable items.
- v8.4 remains authoritative unless Mike explicitly approves a source update.
- Unverified schedule claims must remain "verify before plan change".

## Data / Sync / Environment Scope

- Production Supabase is real Maddox data only.
- Supabase production project ref is `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko` based on local production backup URL and historical docs; treat it as production Maddox data.
- Staging Supabase is for dev/test data once created/configured; current known staging project is `maddox-training-os-staging` with project ref `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`.
- Local development currently points to staging ref `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz` through `.env.local`; `scripts/env-whoami.mjs` classifies local as staging.
- Vercel Production is confirmed by Mike's dashboard check to point to production Supabase ref `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko`.
- Vercel Preview is confirmed by Mike's dashboard check to point to staging Supabase ref `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz` for new deployments.
- Vercel Development is confirmed by Mike's dashboard check to point to staging Supabase ref `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz` for new deployments.
- No Supabase variables remain scoped to All Environments in Vercel.
- Historical old Preview deployments created before the environment split must not be reused for write testing; a fresh 2026-08-21 Preview is runtime/build-verified against staging ref `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`.
- Production runtime smoke after the env split passed on the served `87355a4` deployment: production ref `mbjcedhysniabbaigsko` was present, staging ref `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz` was absent, `/api/kpi-export` returned cloud JSON with count `21`, and key production routes returned 200.
- Current fresh Preview isolation is verified to staging. Any future write-capable Preview test must still confirm the deployment is a current Preview/staging build and must never target Production.
- Supabase staging auto-pause warning is active context for project `npuankmkxbjtlokbpczz`; if staging pauses, local and Preview QA may fail until the project is resumed.
- No fake/test records in production.
- KPI cloud-sync stash exists and is not applied.
- `.env.local.production-backup` exists locally and contains secrets; do not commit or display it.
- Environment docs require reconciliation before any deploy/write/backfill.

## Testing Scope

- App-code changes use the standard check set: `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, `node scripts/verify-v8.4-import.mjs`, `git diff --check`, `git status --short`.
- Documentation-only changes require `git status --short`, `git diff --check`, and markdown/docs lint only if configured.
- GitHub Actions runs Vitest, TypeScript, a clean production build, and the forward Playwright browser suite on PR/main workflows; the suite is proven green after catching and correcting a time-dependent KPI assertion.
- QA automation is active but not fully closed: explicit Today and Plan/Gantt browser smoke coverage and broader release-gate ownership remain under `QA-PLAYWRIGHT-SMOKE-001` / `QA-AUTOMATION-OWNERSHIP-001`.

## Documentation Consolidation / Archive Recommendations

- Keep `AGENTS.md` as rules only.
- Keep `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` as checkpoint only.
- Keep `docs/AGENT_REPORT.md` as latest report only.
- Keep `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INVENTORY.md` as temporary inventory/consolidation tracker.
- Keep former scope-like docs as dead-end stubs with no historical body.
- Archive candidates after Mike review: former handoff/state stubs, old implementation notes that are superseded by tests/docs.
- Historical detail remains available through git history only.

## Items Intentionally Deferred

- KPI cloud-sync stash.
- Production/staging write tests.
- Remaining blocked Activity Prescription follow-ups outside the completed canonical presentation slices.
- Further activity-specific logging expansion beyond the currently implemented date-level flow.
- OvertimeAthlete source ingestion.
- Gemini workflow/tooling setup.
- Husky/pre-commit hook setup.
- Additional Playwright coverage beyond the active core-route smoke task.
- AI Coach implementation.
